    {text: "input: Case Response 3The original appeal of Crocs in the early 2000s was the Croslite material that provided comfort, durability, and easy maintenance. Additionally, because the shoes were designed for boating, they were lightweight, slip-resistant, slipped on and off and provided ventilation. As a result, many boaters, gardeners, and service workers embraced the shoe. In 2006, Crocs purchased Jibbitz, an accessory that could snap into the holes in Crocs for a personalized effect. These Jibbitz allowed people to customize their Crocs, which heightens their appeal. Croc's competitive advantage during these early years was its flexible supply chain. They could quickly distribute and manufacture additional products during a selling season, enabling the company to handle its explosive brand growth. On the other hand, other footwear brands had to estimate their demand, which can cause an under- or overestimation of the needed inventory. During the 2002 to 2007 period, Crocs experienced exponential growth as global sales rose from $1.2 million in 2003 to $850 million in 2007. In 2006, Crocs purchased many smaller companies, such as Jibbitz and EXO, expanded the product line to over 250 styles, and opened hundreds of stores. However, accompanying their expansion was criticism. Fashion influencers and the media criticized the shoes, calling them ugly and making memes of them. In 2008, the global economic downturn worsened the situation, causing Crocs to nearly file for bankruptcy. Finally, in 2010, the brand held on and launched the \"Feel the Love\" campaign. One of the issues that Crocs faced was its inconsistent brand image. Originally, the brand sold Croc Clogs; however, following their success in 2006, they expanded their product line to over 250 styles, including, but not limited to, golf shoes, regular shoes such as Mary Janes, boots, loafers, etc. This rapid introduction of new products caused consumers to be confused and unsure of what Crocs stood for. Additionally, Crocs opened hundreds of physical locations without a proper strategy. They were so focused on expanding that they lost sight of their original customer base and brand image, as shown in the Starbucks Case Study. Another issue that Crocs faced was it was in the inept set. Many consumers were aware of Crocs, however, they didn't want to purchase it because fashion influencers and the media called the shoes ugly. To overcome this problem Crocs could leverage social proof to normalize wearing Crocs. They can also revive the brand image by reducing the product lines to refocus on Clogs. This was exactly what Crocs' new CEO, Mr Rees, did. First, he closed hundreds of retail shops and refocused his attention on the clogs, removing non-clogs from the SKU. Next, he launched the #FindYourFun campaign to encourage people to post pictures of their Clogs on social media and invested in paid social media promotions such as Tweets to leverage social proof. The two main segments Crocs identifies are the \"Feel Goods,\" these are majority female, ages 35-45, suburban-dwelling, and have a family. The \"Feel Goods\" are the brand's core consumers in the U.S. Market. The other segment is the \"Explores,\" which are ages 25-30, urban-dwelling, with an interest in fashion and self-expression. The \"Explorers\" have a higher lifetime value because they are willing to spend more money on a trendy product. They are also mainly based in Asia. The role of the \"Feel Goods\" is to serve as the core customers of Crocs, while the role of the \"Explorer\" is to drive innovation and enhance the brand's image. The \"Feel Goods\" enact this role by frequently purchasing Croc and reinforcing their brand image as a comfortable footwear brand. On the other hand, the \"Explorers\" enact their role by participating in campaigns such as the #FindYourFun campaign, finding the latest trends for Crocs by posting on social media, and sharing their fashion choices. These two segments interact with one another through demands that shape the product development of Crocs. Since Crocs focuses a lot on user-generated content, both the \"Feel Goods\" and the \"Explorers\" can interact to provide feedback. Additionally, they can interact together with the gamification elements provided by Crocs, such as the events on Zepeto and Roblox. I think the challenge that Crocs will face when entering a new market is having to face established competitors such as Birkenstock. Another challenge is having to adapt to the needs and preferences of different markets because, in different areas around the world, sandals can be made of different materials that aren't the plastic used for making clogs. Overall I agree with the decision to add sandals to the product line because it is well within Crocs' latitude of acceptance to start to position themselves as a footwear company instead of a company that only sells clogs. Furthermore, Crocs has been selling clogs for nearly two decades, therefore it is appropriate to expand their markets as long as they don't introduce a crazy big line of products suddenly like they did in 2006. I feel that Crocs should continue to stay ugly because they have already built a huge brand image that revolves around the \"ugliness\" and uniqueness of Crocs. Additionally, switching to a more aesthetically pleasing shoe could result in Crocs losing their loyal customer base."},

    {text: "input: Case Response 1One of the factors that accounted for the extraordinary success of Starbucks in the 1990s was Howard Schultz’s notion of creating a “third place,” which at the time, many Americans didn’t have. Through Schultz’s unique approach, he was able to resonate with customers at a deeper level, which would ultimately lead to the success of Starbucks. Starbucks' value proposition was so compelling because it allowed Starbucks to differentiate itself from other coffee shops by creating an \"experience\" around the consumption of coffee. Not only were the coffees extremely high quality, but the value proposition ensured that the customers were satisfied with the experience and the atmosphere within Starbucks. Finally, I believe that the brand image developed by Starbucks during this time was professional, premium, and welcoming.I believe that Starbucks' customer satisfaction scores are declining due to the rising notion that Starbucks values making money more than the satisfaction of their customers. According to the data in the case study, 61% of respondents felt that Starbucks cares primarily about making money, and 55% of respondents felt that Starbucks cares primarily about building more stores. This causes the customers to feel less valued coupled with the declining speed of service causing declining satisfaction. I believe the company's service hasn't declined because Starbucks measures customer satisfaction based on the speed of service. As a result of this, many other factors can be overlooked such as the atmosphere of the store or the quality of the coffees. Furthermore, according to Table B on page 11, 54% of consumers associate the Starbucks brand with specialty/gourmet coffee which goes to show their approach to measuring customer satisfaction didn't fully capture the customer experience.An ideal Starbucks customer from a profitability standpoint would be a loyal customer who would frequently purchase items from Starbucks, additionally, this customer would also spread the brand's name to family or friends. To ensure that these customers are highly satisfied, Starbucks would need to provide great customer service, initiate conversion with the customer, and deliver high-quality products to customers to meet their expectations. I believe that a highly satisfied customer is extremely valuable to Starbucks because they would purchase items more frequently. According to the example provided in the case study, Starbucks' SVC (store-valued card) increased customer satisfaction which led to cardholders visiting Starbucks twice as often when compared to non-cardholders, resulting in $160 million in sales. The Starbucks of 2002 differs significantly from the Starbucks of 1992. Firstly, the Starbucks of 2002 expanded significantly, with thousands of stores opened in North America and internationally. Similarly, the customer base for the company also expanded from primarily being affluent, well-educated, white-collared professionals to encompassing younger, less educated, and in a lower tax bracket customers. Additionally, the current Starbucks has a wider selection of goods on its menu compared to the old menu which was mostly coffee. Finally, the customer's behaviors changed from customers who were coffee enthusiasts and connoisseurs to customers who view Starbucks as a convenient coffee spot. Yes, I believe that Starbucks should make the $40 million investment in labor in the stores because it addresses the primary customer complaint about slow services. Not only would the $40 million investment speed up service speed, but it would also create more time for baristas to engage on a personal level with the customers which would increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. The goal of this investment is to regain the satisfaction of the customers and reconnect with the customers, as after becoming a more prominent brand, Starbucks lost sight of the customers' experiences and concentrated more on expanding the brand. I do believe that a mega-brand can deliver customer intimacy. The way that the brand can do this is by engaging with the customers on a lower level, such as by providing a great local store experience or allowing the customers to provide feedback so the customers can feel that their voices are being heard."},
    {text: "output: The Success of Starbucks: A Comprehensive Analysis\nIntroduction\nThe rise of Starbucks during the\n 1990s is often regarded as a hallmark of strategic marketing and \nexceptional customer service. This piece synthesizes multiple \nperspectives on the factors that led to Starbucks' extraordinary \nsuccess, the evolving customer satisfaction dynamics, and strategic \nrecommendations for sustaining growth and customer loyalty.\nFactors Contributing to Starbucks' Success in the 1990s\nCreating the \"Third Place\" Concept\nVisionary Leadership:\n Howard Schultz's vision of Starbucks as a \"third place\" between home \nand work resonated with many Americans who lacked such spaces.Experience over Product:\n Starbucks distinguished itself by providing an experience centered \naround coffee, rather than just focusing on the beverage itself.High-Quality Products: The company ensured that the coffees were of extremely high quality.Brand Image: Starbucks successfully cultivated a brand image that was professional, premium, and welcoming.\nDecline in Customer Satisfaction\nShift in Perceptions\nProfit Over People:\n Data indicated that a significant number of respondents believed \nStarbucks prioritized making money (61%) and expanding stores (55%) over\n customer satisfaction.Speed of Service:\n Customer satisfaction scores were falling, attributed mainly to the \ndeclining speed of service, which overlooked other important factors \nsuch as store atmosphere and coffee quality.\nIdeal Starbucks Customer\nCharacteristics of a Profitable Customer\nLoyalty and Frequency: The ideal Starbucks customer is one who frequents the store often and promotes the brand to friends and family.Value of High Satisfaction:\n Highly satisfied customers tend to visit more often and spend more.

    {text: "input: A new study from researchers at MIT and Penn State University reveals \nthat if large language models were to be used in home surveillance, they\n could recommend calling the police even when surveillance videos show \nno criminal activity.\n\nIn addition, the models the researchers studied were inconsistent in \nwhich videos they flagged for police intervention. For instance, a model\n might flag one video that shows a vehicle break-in but not flag another\n video that shows a similar activity. Models often disagreed with one \nanother over whether to call the police for the same video.\n\nFurthermore, the researchers found that some models flagged videos for \npolice intervention relatively less often in neighborhoods where most \nresidents are white, controlling for other factors. This shows that the \nmodels exhibit inherent biases influenced by the demographics of a \nneighborhood, the researchers say.\n\nThese results indicate that models are inconsistent in how they apply \nsocial norms to surveillance videos that portray similar activities. \nThis phenomenon, which the researchers call norm inconsistency, makes it\n difficult to predict how models would behave in different contexts.\n\n“The move-fast, break-things modus operandi of deploying generative AI \nmodels everywhere, and particularly in high-stakes settings, deserves \nmuch more thought since it could be quite harmful,” says co-senior \nauthor Ashia Wilson, the Lister Brothers Career Development Professor in\n the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a \nprincipal investigator in the Laboratory for Information and Decision \nSystems (LIDS).\n\nMoreover, because researchers can’t access the training data or inner \nworkings of these proprietary AI models, they can’t determine the root \ncause of norm inconsistency.\n\nWhile large language models (LLMs) may not be currently deployed in real\n surveillance settings, they are being used to make normative decisions \nin other high-stakes settings, such as health care, mortgage lending, \nand hiring. It seems likely models would show similar inconsistencies in\n these situations, Wilson says.\n\n“There is this implicit belief that these LLMs have learned, or can \nlearn, some set of norms and values. Our work is showing that is not the\n case. Maybe all they are learning is arbitrary patterns or noise,” says\n lead author Shomik Jain, a graduate student in the Institute for Data, \nSystems, and Society (IDSS).\n\nWilson and Jain are joined on the paper by co-senior author Dana Calacci\n PhD ’23, an assistant professor at the Penn State University College of\n Information Science and Technology. The research will be presented at \nthe AAAI Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society.\n\n“A real, imminent, practical threat”\n\nThe study grew out of a dataset containing thousands of Amazon Ring home\n surveillance videos, which Calacci built in 2020, while she was a \ngraduate student in the MIT Media Lab. Ring, a maker of smart home \nsurveillance cameras that was acquired by Amazon in 2018, provides \ncustomers with access to a social network called Neighbors where they \ncan share and discuss videos.\n\nCalacci’s prior research indicated that people sometimes use the \nplatform to “racially gatekeep” a neighborhood by determining who does \nand does not belong there based on skin-tones of video subjects. She \nplanned to train algorithms that automatically caption videos to study \nhow people use the Neighbors platform, but at the time existing \nalgorithms weren’t good enough at captioning.\n\nThe project pivoted with the explosion of LLMs.\n\n“There is a real, imminent, practical threat of someone using \noff-the-shelf generative AI models to look at videos, alert a homeowner,\n and automatically call law enforcement. We wanted to understand how \nrisky that was,” Calacci says.\n\nThe researchers chose three LLMs — GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude — and \nshowed them real videos posted to the Neighbors platform from Calacci’s \ndataset. They asked the models two questions: “Is a crime happening in \nthe video?” and “Would the model recommend calling the police?”\n\nThey had humans annotate videos to identify whether it was day or night,\n the type of activity, and the gender and skin-tone of the subject. The \nresearchers also used census data to collect demographic information \nabout neighborhoods the videos were recorded in.\n\nInconsistent decisions\n\nThey found that all three models nearly always said no crime occurs in \nthe videos, or gave an ambiguous response, even though 39 percent did \nshow a crime.\n\n“Our hypothesis is that the companies that develop these models have \ntaken a conservative approach by restricting what the models can say,” \nJain says.\n\nBut even though the models said most videos contained no crime, they \nrecommend calling the police for between 20 and 45 percent of videos.\n\nWhen the researchers drilled down on the neighborhood demographic \ninformation, they saw that some models were less likely to recommend \ncalling the police in majority-white neighborhoods, controlling for \nother factors.\n\nThey found this surprising because the models were given no information \non neighborhood demographics, and the videos only showed an area a few \nyards beyond a home’s front door.\n\nIn addition to asking the models about crime in the videos, the \nresearchers also prompted them to offer reasons for why they made those \nchoices. When they examined these data, they found that models were more\n likely to use terms like “delivery workers” in majority white \nneighborhoods, but terms like “burglary tools” or “casing the property” \nin neighborhoods with a higher proportion of residents of color.\n\n“Maybe there is something about the background conditions of these \nvideos that gives the models this implicit bias. It is hard to tell \nwhere these inconsistencies are coming from because there is not a lot \nof transparency into these models or the data they have been trained \non,” Jain says.\n\nThe researchers were also surprised that skin tone of people in the \nvideos did not play a significant role in whether a model recommended \ncalling police. They hypothesize this is because the machine-learning \nresearch community has focused on mitigating skin-tone bias.\n\n“But it is hard to control for the innumerable number of biases you \nmight find. It is almost like a game of whack-a-mole. You can mitigate \none and another bias pops up somewhere else,” Jain says.\n\nMany mitigation techniques require knowing the bias at the outset. If \nthese models were deployed, a firm might test for skin-tone bias, but \nneighborhood demographic bias would probably go completely unnoticed, \nCalacci adds.\n\n“We have our own stereotypes of how models can be biased that firms test\n for before they deploy a model. Our results show that is not enough,” \nshe says.\n\nTo that end, one project Calacci and her collaborators hope to work on \nis a system that makes it easier for people to identify and report AI \nbiases and potential harms to firms and government agencies.\n\nThe researchers also want to study how the normative judgements LLMs \nmake in high-stakes situations compare to those humans would make, as \nwell as the facts LLMs understand about these scenarios.\n\nThis work was funded, in part, by the IDSS’s Initiative on Combating \nSystemic Racism."},
    {text: "output: Ethical Implications and Bias in Large Language Models for Surveillance\nIntroduction\nRecent studies from MIT and Penn\n State University have revealed significant ethical and functional \nchallenges associated with using large language models (LLMs) in \nsurveillance. These models, while advanced, exhibit inconsistencies and \ninherent biases that make their application in high-stakes environments \nparticularly problematic.\nKey Findings\nInconsistencies in Crime Detection\nNorm Inconsistency: LLMs showed variability in applying social norms to similar surveillance activities, leading to inconsistent decisions.Crime Flagging Inconsistencies: Different models flagged different videos inconsistently, even when the activities shown were similar.Recommendation Discrepancies: Despite often recognizing no crime, LLMs recommended calling the police in 20-45% of the cases.\nBiases and Ethical Concerns\nDemographic Bias:\n Models were less likely to recommend police intervention in \nmajority-white neighborhoods, indicating a demographic bias that was not\n explicitly programmed.Implicit Bias in Descriptions:\n Videos from neighborhoods with higher proportions of residents of color\n were more likely to receive negative descriptions such as \"burglary \ntools\" whereas majority-white neighborhoods saw terms like \"delivery \nworkers\".Non-Transparence Issue:\n Researchers cannot determine the root cause of these biases due to the \ninaccessibility of the proprietary training data behind these models.\nBroader Implications\nHigh-Stakes Environment Risks:\n Similar inconsistencies and biases can potentially affect other \nhigh-stakes areas such as healthcare, mortgage lending, and hiring, \nwhere LLMs are increasingly being deployed.Bias Mitigation Challenges:\n While efforts have been made to control for biases like skin-tone, new \nbiases such as those related to neighborhood demographics may emerge and\n go unnoticed, making it nearly impossible to mitigate all prejudices \neffectively.Accountability and Transparency:\n Current proprietary systems lack the transparency needed for \nresearchers and developers to identify and rectify these biases \neffectively.\nResearch Background\nDataset and Methodology\nAmazon Ring Dataset:\n The study utilized a dataset of thousands of Amazon Ring home \nsurveillance videos, annotated for various factors including time of \nday, type of activity, gender, and skin tone of subjects, as well as \nneighborhood demographics using census data.Model Selection:\n The LLMs examined included GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. These models were\n questioned to determine the occurrence of a crime and whether police \nintervention should be recommended.\nFuture Directions\nEnhanced Bias Reporting\nSystem Development:\n Efforts are underway to develop systems that facilitate the reporting \nof AI biases and potential harms by the public to firms and government \nagencies.Comprehensive Evaluations:\n Further studies aim to compare how LLMs' judgments in high-stakes \nscenarios align with human decision-making and the factual bases of \nthese judgments.\nEthical Deployment\nControlled Usage:\n Due to the demonstrated risks, there is a call for more thoughtful and \ncontrolled deployment of generative AI models in critical settings.Ongoing Monitoring:\n Continuous monitoring and iterative improvements are essential to \nsafeguard against evolving biases and to ensure ethical AI applications.\nConclusion\nWhile large language models hold\n significant potential, their deployment, particularly in surveillance \nand other high-stakes settings, must be approached with caution. \nInconsistencies and hidden biases pose real ethical challenges that \nrequire comprehensive strategies for mitigation and transparent \npractices for development and usage.

    {text: "input: ver\n been asked a question you only knew part of the answer to? To give a\n more informed response, your best move would be to phone a friend with \nmore knowledge on the subject.\n\nThis collaborative process can also help large language models (LLMs) \nimprove their accuracy. Still, it’s been difficult to teach LLMs to \nrecognize when they should collaborate with another model on an answer. \nInstead of using complex formulas or large amounts of labeled data to \nspell out where models should work together, researchers at MIT’s \nComputer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have \nenvisioned a more organic approach.\n\nTheir new algorithm, called “Co-LLM,” can pair a general-purpose base \nLLM with a more specialized model and help them work together. As the \nformer crafts an answer, Co-LLM reviews each word (or token) within its \nresponse to see where it can call upon a more accurate answer from the \nexpert model. This process leads to more accurate replies to things like\n medical prompts and math and reasoning problems. Since the expert model\n is not needed at each iteration, this also leads to more efficient \nresponse generation.\n\nTo decide when a base model needs help from an expert model, the \nframework uses machine learning to train a “switch variable,” or a tool \nthat can indicate the competence of each word within the two LLMs’ \nresponses. The switch is like a project manager, finding areas where it \nshould call in a specialist. If you asked Co-LLM to name some examples \nof extinct bear species, for instance, two models would draft answers \ntogether. The general-purpose LLM begins to put together a reply, with \nthe switch variable intervening at the parts where it can slot in a \nbetter token from the expert model, such as adding the year when the \nbear species became extinct.\n\n“With Co-LLM, we’re essentially training a general-purpose LLM to \n‘phone’ an expert model when needed,” says Shannon Shen, an MIT PhD \nstudent in electrical engineering and computer science and CSAIL \naffiliate who’s a lead author on a new paper about the approach. “We use\n domain-specific data to teach the base model about its counterpart’s \nexpertise in areas like biomedical tasks and math and reasoning \nquestions. This process automatically finds the parts of the data that \nare hard for the base model to generate, and then it instructs the base \nmodel to switch to the expert LLM, which was pretrained on data from a \nsimilar field. The general-purpose model provides the ‘scaffolding’ \ngeneration, and when it calls on the specialized LLM, it prompts the \nexpert to generate the desired tokens. Our findings indicate that the \nLLMs learn patterns of collaboration organically, resembling how humans \nrecognize when to call upon an expert to fill in the blanks.”\n\nA combination of flexibility and factuality\n\nImagine asking a general-purpose LLM to name the ingredients of a \nspecific prescription drug. It may reply incorrectly, necessitating the \nexpertise of a specialized model.\n\nTo showcase Co-LLM’s flexibility, the researchers used data like the \nBioASQ medical set to couple a base LLM with expert LLMs in different \ndomains, like the Meditron model, which is pretrained on unlabeled \nmedical data. This enabled the algorithm to help answer inquiries a \nbiomedical expert would typically receive, such as naming the mechanisms\n causing a particular disease.\n\nFor example, if you asked a simple LLM alone to name the ingredients of a\n specific prescription drug, it may reply incorrectly. With the added \nexpertise of a model that specializes in biomedical data, you’d get a \nmore accurate answer. Co-LLM also alerts users where to double-check \nanswers.\n\nAnother example of Co-LLM’s performance boost: When tasked with solving a\n math problem like “a3 · a2 if a=5,” the general-purpose model \nincorrectly calculated the answer to be 125. As Co-LLM trained the model\n to collaborate more with a large math LLM called Llemma, together they \ndetermined that the correct solution was 3,125.\n\nCo-LLM gave more accurate replies than fine-tuned simple LLMs and \nuntuned specialized models working independently. Co-LLM can guide two \nmodels that were trained differently to work together, whereas other \neffective LLM collaboration approaches, such as “Proxy Tuning,” need all\n of their component models to be trained similarly. Additionally, this \nbaseline requires each model to be used simultaneously to produce the \nanswer, whereas MIT’s algorithm simply activates its expert model for \nparticular tokens, leading to more efficient generation.\n\nWhen to ask the expert\n\nThe MIT researchers’ algorithm highlights that imitating human teamwork \nmore closely can increase accuracy in multi-LLM collaboration. To \nfurther elevate its factual precision, the team may draw from human \nself-correction: They’re considering a more robust deferral approach \nthat can backtrack when the expert model doesn’t give a correct \nresponse. This upgrade would allow Co-LLM to course-correct so the \nalgorithm can still give a satisfactory reply.\n\nThe team would also like to update the expert model (via only training \nthe base model) when new information is available, keeping answers as \ncurrent as possible. This would allow Co-LLM to pair the most up-to-date\n information with strong reasoning power.

    {text: "output: Enhancing Language Models through Expert Collaboration: The Co-LLM Approach\nIntroduction to Co-LLM\nAs collaborative techniques \nbecome increasingly pivotal in artificial intelligence, researchers at \nMIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) \nhave pioneered an innovative framework known as Co-LLM. This new \nalgorithm harmonizes the capabilities of general-purpose large language \nmodels (LLMs) and expert models to deliver more precise and efficient \noutputs.\nThe Concept of Co-LLM\nPurpose:\n The primary goal of Co-LLM is to improve the accuracy and efficiency of\n responses generated by LLMs by leveraging collaboration between a \ngeneral-purpose model and more specialized expert models.Mechanism:\n Co-LLM deploys a \"switch variable\" that functions analogously to a \nproject manager, deciding when to call on an expert model based on the \ncomplexity of the task at hand.\nKey Elements and Innovations of Co-LLM\nOrganic Collaboration\nCo-LLM is designed to train \ngeneral-purpose LLMs to 'phone' or consult expert models when needed. \nThis mirrors human behavior where individuals seek input from \nspecialists for complex or domain-specific questions.\nThe Flexibility of Co-LLM\nDomain Adaptability:\n Researchers demonstrated Co-LLM's adaptability using domain-specific \ndatasets like the BioASQ medical set, coupling a base LLM with \ndomain-specific expert LLMs, such as the Meditron model (pretrained on \nmedical data).Sample Task:\n For instance, when asked to name the ingredients of a specific \nprescription drug, a general-purpose LLM might give an incorrect answer.\n However, with Co-LLM, the expertise of a biomedical specialist model \nrefines the response, ensuring higher accuracy.\nPerformance Boost in Complex Tasks\nMathematical Reasoning Example:\n When faced with a math problem, Co-LLM directed a general-purpose model\n to collaborate with a specialized math LLM called Llemma. This \ncollaboration produced the correct answer (3,125) rather than an \nincorrect one (125) generated by the base model alone.Efficiency and Accuracy:\n Co-LLM not only improves the accuracy of responses but also promotes \nefficiency by activating the expert model selectively, thus conserving \ncomputational resources.\nThe Future of Co-LLM\nEnhanced Decision-Making:\n By imitating human teamwork, Co-LLM is positioned to significantly \nincrease accuracy in multi-LLM collaboration. Plans are underway to \nintroduce a more robust deferral mechanism that can backtrack if \nincorrect advice is given by the expert model, mimicking human \nself-correction processes.Continuous Updates:\n Researchers aim to ensure that Co-LLM remains up-to-date with the \nlatest information by updating the expert model continuously. This would\n enable the model to provide the most current and accurate responses, \nbenefiting various applications such as enterprise documentation.\nPotential Applications\nEnterprise Documents:\n Co-LLM could assist in updating enterprise documents with the most \nrecent information, thereby enhancing the usability and relevance of \ninternal resources.Private Models:\n Training small, private models to work synergistically with powerful \nLLMs can improve document management within secure servers, maintaining \nprivacy while boosting performance.\nExpert Opinions\nColin Raffel, associate \nprofessor at the University of Toronto, praises Co-LLM for providing a \ngranular way of making token-level routing decisions, which adds \nsignificant flexibility compared to similar methods. According to \nRaffel, Co-LLM contributes importantly to the development of ecosystems \nof specialized models that outperform expensive monolithic AI systems.\nConclusion\nThe Co-LLM framework is a \ngroundbreaking step in the evolution of large language models, \nemphasizing the vital role of expert collaboration. By efficiently \ncombining general-purpose LLMs with domain-specific models, Co-LLM \nexemplifies how AI can achieve higher accuracy and performance, opening \nthe door to more reliable and versatile applications in various fields."},
    {text: "input: Computer\n graphics and geometry processing research provide the tools needed to \nsimulate physical phenomena like fire and flames, aiding the \ncreation of visual effects in video games and movies as well as the \nfabrication of complex geometric shapes using tools like 3D printing.\n\nUnder the hood, mathematical problems called partial differential \nequations (PDEs) model these natural processes. Among the many PDEs used\n in physics and computer graphics, a class called second-order parabolic\n PDEs explain how phenomena can become smooth over time. The most famous\n example in this class is the heat equation, which predicts how heat \ndiffuses along a surface or in a volume over time.\n\nResearchers in geometry processing have designed numerous algorithms to \nsolve these problems on curved surfaces, but their methods often apply \nonly to linear problems or to a single PDE. A more general approach by \nresearchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence \nLaboratory (CSAIL) tackles a general class of these potentially \nnonlinear problems. \n\nIn a paper recently published in the Transactions on Graphics journal \nand presented at the SIGGRAPH conference, they describe an algorithm \nthat solves different nonlinear parabolic PDEs on triangle meshes by \nsplitting them into three simpler equations that can be solved with \ntechniques graphics researchers already have in their software toolkit. \nThis framework can help better analyze shapes and model complex \ndynamical processes.\n\n“We provide a recipe: If you want to numerically solve a second-order \nparabolic PDE, you can follow a set of three steps,” says lead author \nLeticia Mattos Da Silva SM ’23, an MIT PhD student in electrical \nengineering and computer science (EECS) and CSAIL affiliate. “For each \nof the steps in this approach, you’re solving a simpler problem using \nsimpler tools from geometry processing, but at the end, you get a \nsolution to the more challenging second-order parabolic PDE.”\n\nTo accomplish this, Da Silva and her coauthors used Strang splitting, a \ntechnique that allows geometry processing researchers to break the PDE \ndown into problems they know how to solve efficiently.\n\nFirst, their algorithm advances a solution forward in time by solving \nthe heat equation (also called the “diffusion equation”), which models \nhow heat from a source spreads over a shape. Picture using a blow torch \nto warm up a metal plate — this equation describes how heat from that \nspot would diffuse over it. This step can be completed easily with \nlinear algebra.\n\nNow, imagine that the parabolic PDE has additional nonlinear behaviors \nthat are not described by the spread of heat. This is where the second \nstep of the algorithm comes in: it accounts for the nonlinear piece by \nsolving a Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equation, a first-order nonlinear PDE. \n\nWhile generic HJ equations can be hard to solve, Mattos Da Silva and \ncoauthors prove that their splitting method applied to many important \nPDEs yields an HJ equation that can be solved via convex optimization \nalgorithms. Convex optimization is a standard tool for which researchers\n in geometry processing already have efficient and reliable software. In\n the final step, the algorithm advances a solution forward in time using\n the heat equation again to advance the more complex second-order \nparabolic PDE forward in time.\n\nAmong other applications, the framework could help simulate fire and \nflames more efficiently. “There’s a huge pipeline that creates a video \nwith flames being simulated, but at the heart of it is a PDE solver,” \nsays Mattos Da Silva. For these pipelines, an essential step is solving \nthe G-equation, a nonlinear parabolic PDE that models the front \npropagation of the flame and can be solved using the researchers’ \nframework.\n\nThe team’s algorithm can also solve the diffusion equation in the \nlogarithmic domain, where it becomes nonlinear. Senior author Justin \nSolomon, associate professor of EECS and leader of the CSAIL Geometric \nData Processing Group, previously developed a state-of-the-art technique\n for optimal transport that requires taking the logarithm of the result \nof heat diffusion. Mattos Da Silva’s framework provided more reliable \ncomputations by doing diffusion directly in the logarithmic domain. This\n enabled a more stable way to, for example, find a geometric notion of \naverage among distributions on surface meshes like a model of a koala.\n\nEven though their framework focuses on general, nonlinear problems, it \ncan also be used to solve linear PDE. For instance, the method solves \nthe Fokker-Planck equation, where heat diffuses in a linear way, but \nthere are additional terms that drift in the same direction heat is \nspreading. In a straightforward application, the approach modeled how \nswirls would evolve over the surface of a triangulated sphere. The \nresult resembles purple-and-brown latte art.\n\nThe researchers note that this project is a starting point for tackling \nthe nonlinearity in other PDEs that appear in graphics and geometry \nprocessing head-on. For example, they focused on static surfaces but \nwould like to apply their work to moving ones, too. Moreover, their \nframework solves problems involving a single parabolic PDE, but the team\n would also like to tackle problems involving coupled parabolic PDE. \nThese types of problems arise in biology and chemistry, where the \nequation describing the evolution of each agent in a mixture, for \nexample, is linked to the others’ equations.\n\nMattos Da Silva and Solomon wrote the paper with Oded Stein, assistant \nprofessor at the University of Southern California’s Viterbi School of \nEngineering.

    {text: "input: In\n 2021, a team led by MIT physicists reported creating a new ultrathin \nferroelectric material, or one where positive and negative charges \nseparate into different layers. At the time they noted the material’s \npotential for applications in computer memory and much more. Now the \nsame core team and colleagues — including two from the lab next door — \nhave built a transistor with that material and shown that its properties\n are so useful that it could change the world of electronics.\n\nAlthough the team’s results are based on a single transistor in the lab,\n “in several aspects its properties already meet or exceed industry \nstandards” for the ferroelectric transistors produced today, says Pablo \nJarillo-Herrero, the Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Physics, who led \nthe work with professor of physics Raymond Ashoori. Both are also \naffiliated with the Materials Research Laboratory.\n\n“In my lab we primarily do fundamental physics. This is one of the \nfirst, and perhaps most dramatic, examples of how very basic science has\n led to something that could have a major impact on applications,” \nJarillo-Herrero says.\n\nSays Ashoori, “When I think of my whole career in physics, this is the \nwork that I think 10 to 20 years from now could change the world.”\n\nAmong the new transistor’s superlative properties:\n\n    It can switch between positive and negative charges — essentially \nthe ones and zeros of digital information — at very high speeds, on \nnanosecond time scales. (A nanosecond is a billionth of a second.)  It \nis extremely tough. After 100 billion switches it still worked with no \nsigns of degradation.\n    The material behind the magic is only billionths of a meter thick, \none of the thinnest of its kind in the world. That, in turn, could allow\n for much denser computer memory storage. It could also lead to much \nmore energy-efficient transistors because the voltage required for \nswitching scales with material thickness. (Ultrathin equals ultralow \nvoltages.)\n\nThe work is reported in a recent issue of Science. The co-first authors \nof the paper are Kenji Yasuda, now an assistant professor at Cornell \nUniversity, and Evan Zalys-Geller, now at Atom Computing. Additional \nauthors are Xirui Wang, an MIT graduate student in physics; Daniel \nBennett and Efthimios Kaxiras of Harvard University; Suraj S. Cheema, an\n assistant professor in MIT’s Department of Electrical Engineering and \nComputer Science and an affiliate of the Research Laboratory of \nElectronics; and Kenji Watanabe and Takashi Taniguchi of the National \nInstitute for Materials Science in Japan.\n\nWhat they did\n\nIn a ferroelectric material, positive and negative charges spontaneously\n head to different sides, or poles. Upon the application of an external \nelectric field, those charges switch sides, reversing the polarization. \nSwitching the polarization can be used to encode digital information, \nand that information will be nonvolatile, or stable over time. It won’t \nchange unless an electric field is applied. For a ferroelectric to have \nbroad application to electronics, all of this needs to happen at room \ntemperature.\n\nThe new ferroelectric material reported in Science in 2021 is based on \natomically thin sheets of boron nitride that are stacked parallel to \neach other, a configuration that doesn’t exist in nature. In bulk boron \nnitride, the individual layers of boron nitride are instead rotated by \n180 degrees.\n\nIt turns out that when an electric field is applied to this parallel \nstacked configuration, one layer of the new boron nitride material \nslides over the other, slightly changing the positions of the boron and \nnitrogen atoms. For example, imagine that each of your hands is composed\n of only one layer of cells. The new phenomenon is akin to pressing your\n hands together then slightly shifting one above the other.\n\n“So the miracle is that by sliding the two layers a few angstroms, you \nend up with radically different electronics,” says Ashoori. The diameter\n of an atom is about 1 angstrom.\n\nAnother miracle: “nothing wears out in the sliding,” Ashoori continues. \nThat’s why the new transistor could be switched 100 billion times \nwithout degrading. Compare that to the memory in a flash drive made with\n conventional materials. “Each time you write and erase a flash memory, \nyou get some degradation,” says Ashoori. “Over time, it wears out, which\n means that you have to use some very sophisticated methods for \ndistributing where you’re reading and writing on the chip.” The new \nmaterial could make those steps obsolete.\n\nA collaborative effort\n\nYasuda, the co-first author of the current Science paper, applauds the \ncollaborations involved in the work. Among them, “we [Jarillo-Herrero’s \nteam] made the material and, together with Ray [Ashoori] and [co-first \nauthor] Evan [Zalys-Geller], we measured its characteristics in detail. \nThat was very exciting.” Says Ashoori, “many of the techniques in my lab\n just naturally applied to work that was going on in the lab next door. \nIt’s been a lot of fun.”\n\nAshoori notes that “there’s a lot of interesting physics behind this” \nthat could be explored. For example, “if you think about the two layers \nsliding past each other, where does that sliding start?” In addition, \nsays Yasuda, could the ferroelectricity be triggered with something \nother than electricity, like an optical pulse? And is there a \nfundamental limit to the amount of switches the material can make?\n\nChallenges remain. For example, the current way of producing the new \nferroelectrics is difficult and not conducive to mass manufacturing. “We\n made a single transistor as a demonstration. If people could grow these\n materials on the wafer scale, we could create many, many more,” says \nYasuda. He notes that different groups are already working to that end.\n\nConcludes Ashoori, “There are a few problems.

    {text: "input: Some of the most widely used drugs today, including penicillin, were \ndiscovered through a process called phenotypic screening. Using this \nmethod, scientists are essentially throwing drugs at a problem — for \nexample, when attempting to stop bacterial growth or fixing a cellular \ndefect — and then observing what happens next, without necessarily first\n knowing how the drug works. Perhaps surprisingly, historical data show \nthat this approach is better at yielding approved medicines than those \ninvestigations that more narrowly focus on specific molecular targets.But\n many scientists believe that properly setting up the problem is the \ntrue key to success. Certain microbial infections or genetic disorders \ncaused by single mutations are much simpler to prototype than complex \ndiseases like cancer. These require intricate biological models that are\n far harder to make or acquire. The result is a bottleneck in the number\n of drugs that can be tested, and thus the usefulness of phenotypic \nscreening.Now, a team of scientists led by the Shalek Lab at MIT\n has developed a promising new way to address the difficulty of applying\n phenotyping screening to scale. Their method allows researchers to \nsimultaneously apply multiple drugs to a biological problem at once, and\n then computationally work backward to figure out the individual effects\n of each. For instance, when the team applied this method to models of \npancreatic cancer and human immune cells, they were able to uncover \nsurprising new biological insights, while also minimizing cost and \nsample requirements by several-fold — solving a few problems in \nscientific research at once.Zev Gartner,\n a professor in pharmaceutical chemistry at the University of California\n at San Francisco, says this new method has great potential. “I think if\n there is a strong phenotype one is interested in, this will be a very \npowerful approach,” Gartner says.The research was published Oct. 8 in Nature Biotechnology.

The most informative tests, \nlike single-cell RNA sequencing, are also expensive, time-consuming, and\n labor-intensive.That’s why the team decided to test out the \n“bold, maybe even crazy idea” to mix everything together, says Liu, a \nPhD student in the MIT Computational and Systems Biology program. In \nother words, they chose to combine many perturbations — things like \ndrugs, chemical molecules, or biological compounds made by cells — into \none single concoction, and then try to decipher their individual effects\n afterward.They began testing their workflow by making different \ncombinations of 316 U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs. \n“It’s a high bar: basically, the worst-case scenario,” says Liu. “Since \nevery drug is known to have a strong effect, the signals could have been\n impossible to disentangle.”These random combinations ranged from\n three to 80 drugs per pool, each of which was applied to lab-grown \ncells. The team then tried to understand the effects of the individual \ndrug using a linear computational model.It was a success.

Some of them \nseem to be sitting in the middle of nowhere,” says Anna-Christina \nEilers, assistant professor of physics at MIT. “It’s difficult to \nexplain how these quasars could have grown so big if they appear to have\n nothing to feed from.”There is a possibility that these quasars \nmay not be as solitary as they appear, but are instead surrounded by \ngalaxies that are heavily shrouded in dust and therefore hidden from \nview. Eilers and her colleagues hope to tune their observations to try \nand see through any such cosmic dust, in order to understand how quasars\n grew so big, so fast, in the early universe.Eilers and her colleagues report their findings in a paper appearing today in the Astrophysical Journal. The\n MIT co-authors include postdocs Rohan Naidu and Minghao Yue; Robert \nSimcoe, the Francis Friedman Professor of Physics and director of MIT’s \nKavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research; and collaborators \nfrom institutions including Leiden University, the University of \nCalifornia at Santa Barbara, ETH Zurich, and elsewhere.Galactic neighborsThe\n five newly observed quasars are among the oldest quasars observed to \ndate. More than 13 billion years old, the objects are thought to have \nformed between 600 to 700 million years after the Big Bang. The \nsupermassive black holes powering the quasars are a billion times more \nmassive than the sun, and more than a trillion times brighter. Due to \ntheir extreme luminosity, the light from each quasar is able to travel \nover the age of the universe, far enough to reach JWST’s highly \nsensitive detectors today.“It’s just phenomenal that we now have a\n telescope that can capture light from 13 billion years ago in so much \ndetail,” Eilers says. “For the first time, JWST enabled us to look at \nthe environment of these quasars, where they grew up, and what their \nneighborhood was like.”The team analyzed images of the five \nancient quasars taken by JWST between August 2022 and June 2023. The \nobservations of each quasar comprised multiple “mosaic” images, or \npartial views of the quasar’s field, which the team effectively stitched\n together to produce a complete picture of each quasar’s surrounding \nneighborhood.The telescope also took measurements of light in \nmultiple wavelengths across each quasar’s field, which the team then \nprocessed to determine whether a given object in the field was light \nfrom a neighboring galaxy, and how far a galaxy is from the much more \nluminous central quasar.“We found that the only difference \nbetween these five quasars is that their environments look so \ndifferent,” Eilers says. “For instance, one quasar has almost 50 \ngalaxies around it, while another has just two. And both quasars are \nwithin the same size, volume, brightness, and time of the universe. That\n was really surprising to see.”"},
    {text: "output: Quasars and Their Early Cosmic Environments: Insights from JWST Observations\nIntroduction\nQuasars are among the brightest \nand most enigmatic objects in the universe. These are the extremely \nluminous cores of distant galaxies, powered by supermassive black holes.\n Recent observations using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have \nprovided unprecedented insights into the early universe, revealing \nsurprising variations in the environments of ancient quasars.\nUnderstanding Quasars\nWhat is a Quasar?\nDefinition: A quasar is the extremely bright core of a galaxy hosting an active supermassive black hole at its center.Mechanism:\n As the black hole draws in surrounding gas and dust, it emits a \ntremendous amount of energy, making quasars some of the most luminous \nobjects in the universe.Historical Observations: Quasars have been observed as early as a few hundred million years after the Big Bang.\nSignificance of Quasars\nBrightness: Quasars are billions of times more massive than the sun and trillions of times brighter.Distance: The light from quasars can travel over the age of the universe, making them observable even from the early cosmic epochs.\nRecent Discoveries Using JWST\nThe Study\nResearch Team:\n Led by MIT, the study involves astrophysicists including Anna-Christina\n Eilers, Rohan Naidu, Minghao Yue, and Robert Simcoe, among others.Publication: The findings are reported in the Astrophysical Journal.\nObservations\nQuasar Fields:\n Using the JWST, the team studied the cosmic surroundings of five known \nancient quasars, dating back more than 13 billion years.Variations in Environments:\n The quasars were found to reside in varying environments—some in \ndensely populated fields with multiple galaxies, while others appeared \nalmost isolated.\nSurprising Findings\nDiverse Neighborhoods: While some quasars are surrounded by up to 50 galaxies, others exist in apparent cosmic voids.Challenges to Existing Models:\n The isolated quasars contradict models predicting that early quasars \nshould be in high-density regions of the universe due to the massive \namounts of matter required to fuel their growth.\nImplications of the Findings\nQuestioning Established Theories\nGrowth Mystery: The presence of quasars in low-density regions challenges existing theories about their rapid growth in the early universe.Dust Shrouds Hypothesis:\n One possibility is that these quasars might be surrounded by galaxies \nhidden by cosmic dust, thus unseen in current observations.\nFuture Research\nFurther Observations:\n Eilers and her colleagues aim to fine-tune their observations to look \nthrough cosmic dust, potentially uncovering hidden galaxies and better \nunderstanding quasar growth mechanisms.\nTechnological Advancements\nJWST Capabilities:\n The telescope's ability to capture detailed light from 13 billion years\n ago opens new frontiers in understanding the early universe and the \nformation of its most luminous objects.\nConclusion\nThe study of ancient quasars \nusing JWST has revealed unexpected diversity in their surrounding \nenvironments.

    {text: "input: In\n the current AI zeitgeist, sequence models have skyrocketed in \npopularity for their ability to analyze data and predict what to do \nnext. For instance, you’ve likely used next-token prediction models like\n ChatGPT, which anticipate each word (token) in a sequence to form \nanswers to users’ queries. There are also full-sequence diffusion models\n like Sora, which convert words into dazzling, realistic visuals by \nsuccessively “denoising” an entire video sequence. Researchers\n from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory \n(CSAIL) have proposed a simple change to the diffusion training scheme \nthat makes this sequence denoising considerably more flexible.When\n applied to fields like computer vision and robotics, the next-token and\n full-sequence diffusion models have capability trade-offs. Next-token \nmodels can spit out sequences that vary in length. However, they make \nthese generations while being unaware of desirable states in the far \nfuture — such as steering its sequence generation toward a certain goal \n10 tokens away — and thus require additional mechanisms for long-horizon\n (long-term) planning. Diffusion models can perform such \nfuture-conditioned sampling, but lack the ability of next-token models \nto generate variable-length sequences.Researchers from \nCSAIL want to combine the strengths of both models, so they created a \nsequence model training technique called “Diffusion Forcing.” The name \ncomes from “Teacher Forcing,” the conventional training scheme that \nbreaks down full sequence generation into the smaller, easier steps of \nnext-token generation (much like a good teacher simplifying a complex \nconcept).        \n\n      \n            \n          \n\n            \n   \n\n  \n        \n\n                             \n                      "},

In the\n case of diffusion models, they gradually add noise to data, which can \nbe viewed as fractional masking. The MIT researchers’ Diffusion Forcing \nmethod trains neural networks to cleanse a collection of tokens, \nremoving different amounts of noise within each one while simultaneously\n predicting the next few tokens. The result: a flexible, reliable \nsequence model that resulted in higher-quality artificial videos and \nmore precise decision-making for robots and AI agents.By\n sorting through noisy data and reliably predicting the next steps in a \ntask, Diffusion Forcing can aid a robot in ignoring visual distractions \nto complete manipulation tasks. It can also generate stable and \nconsistent video sequences and even guide an AI agent through digital \nmazes. This method could potentially enable household and factory robots\n to generalize to new tasks and improve AI-generated entertainment.“Sequence\n models aim to condition on the known past and predict the unknown \nfuture, a type of binary masking. However, masking doesn’t need to be \nbinary,” says lead author, MIT electrical engineering and computer \nscience (EECS) PhD student, and CSAIL member Boyuan Chen. “With \nDiffusion Forcing, we add different levels of noise to each token, \neffectively serving as a type of fractional masking. At test time, our \nsystem can “unmask” a collection of tokens and diffuse a sequence in the\n near future at a lower noise level. It knows what to trust within its \ndata to overcome out-of-distribution inputs.”In several\n experiments, Diffusion Forcing thrived at ignoring misleading data to \nexecute tasks while anticipating future actions.When \nimplemented into a robotic arm, for example, it helped swap two toy \nfruits across three circular mats, a minimal example of a family of \nlong-horizon tasks that require memories. The researchers trained the \nrobot by controlling it from a distance (or teleoperating it) in virtual\n reality. The robot is trained to mimic the user’s movements from its \ncamera. Despite starting from random positions and seeing distractions \nlike a shopping bag blocking the markers, it placed the objects into its\n target spots.To generate videos, they trained \nDiffusion Forcing on “Minecraft” game play and colorful digital \nenvironments created within Google’s DeepMind Lab Simulator.\n When given a single frame of footage, the method produced more stable, \nhigher-resolution videos than comparable baselines like a Sora-like \nfull-sequence diffusion model and ChatGPT-like next-token models. These \napproaches created videos that appeared inconsistent, with the latter \nsometimes failing to generate working video past just 72 frames."},
    {text: "output: Diffusion Forcing: Enhancing AI Sequence Models\nIntroduction\nIn the contemporary AI \nlandscape, sequence models have gained significant attention due to \ntheir capability to analyze data and predict subsequent actions. \nExamples include next-token prediction models like ChatGPT, which \npredict each word in a sequence to form responses, and full-sequence \ndiffusion models like Sora, which create visuals by successively \ndenoising video sequences. Researchers from MIT's Computer Science and \nArtificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) have introduced a novel \ntraining technique known as \"Diffusion Forcing,\" which aims to combine \nthe strengths of both next-token and full-sequence models.\nUnderstanding Diffusion Forcing\nThe Concept\nDiffusion Forcing is a training \nmethodology that enhances the capabilities of sequence models by \nintegrating the principles of teacher forcing and diffusion models. \nTeacher forcing simplifies complex sequence generation by breaking it \ndown into smaller next-token predictions. Diffusion models, on the other\n hand, add noise to data incrementally, facilitating the denoising \nprocess which can be seen as fractional masking.\nKey Features\nFractional Masking:\n Unlike binary masking, Diffusion Forcing introduces different levels of\n noise to each token. This approach allows the model to \"unmask\" tokens \nduring test time by diffusing a sequence with lower noise levels.Future-Conditioned Sampling: Diffusion models are capable of sampling sequences conditioned on future states, an important feature for long-term planning.Adaptive Token Cleansing:\n The model can predict the next set of tokens while simultaneously \nremoving varying amounts of noise from data, enhancing flexibility and \nreliability.\nApplications and Experiments\nRobotic Control\nIn robotics, Diffusion Forcing \nshowcased its ability to manage visual distractions and anticipate \nfuture actions effectively. For instance, in one experiment involving a \nrobotic arm, the methodology enabled the robot to swap two toy fruits \nacross multiple circular mats. This scenario is indicative of long-term \ntasks requiring memory and control. The robot was trained via \nteleoperation in a virtual reality environment, imitating the user’s \nmovements despite starting from random positions and encountering visual\n obstructions.\nVideo Generation\nIn video sequence generation, \nDiffusion Forcing demonstrated superior performance compared to baseline\n models. It was trained on \"Minecraft\" gameplay and environments created\n within Google's DeepMind Lab Simulator. Given a single frame, the \nmethod produced higher resolution and more stable videos than other \nmodels like full-sequence diffusion models and next-token prediction \nmodels, which often produced inconsistent results or failed beyond a \ncertain number of frames.\nImplications and Future Prospects\nEnhancing AI Generalization\nDiffusion Forcing holds the \npotential to significantly enhance the generalization capabilities of AI\n systems, particularly in household and industrial robots. By \neffectively filtering out noisy data and predicting reliable outcomes, \nthese systems can adapt to new tasks and environments, thus improving \ntheir utility in various applications.\nImproving AI-Generated Entertainment\nThe technique also promises \nadvancements in AI-generated entertainment, allowing for the creation of\n more coherent and visually appealing media content. This could pave the\n way for more immersive and engaging digital experiences.\nConclusion\nDiffusion Forcing represents a \npivotal advancement in AI sequence modeling, bridging the gap between \nnext-token prediction and full-sequence diffusion techniques. Its \ninnovative approach to handling noisy data and anticipating future \nstates opens new avenues for research and application in AI, robotics, \nand digital media.\nReferences\nMIT CSAIL (n.d.).

However, these “debunking” efforts don’t\n always have the desired effect, and in some cases, they can lead people\n to cling more tightly to their original position.Neuroscientists\n and political scientists at MIT and the University of California at \nBerkeley have now created a computational model that analyzes the \nfactors that help to determine whether debunking efforts will persuade \npeople to change their beliefs about the legitimacy of an election. \nTheir findings suggest that while debunking fails much of the time, it \ncan be successful under the right conditions.For instance, the \nmodel showed that successful debunking is more likely if people are less\n certain of their original beliefs and if they believe the authority is \nunbiased or strongly motivated by a desire for accuracy. It also helps \nwhen an authority comes out in support of a result that goes against a \nbias they are perceived to hold: for example, Fox News declaring that \nJoseph R. Biden had won in Arizona in the 2020 U.S. presidential \nelection.“When people see an act of debunking, they treat it as a\n human action and understand it the way they understand human actions — \nthat is, as something somebody did for their own reasons,” says Rebecca \nSaxe, the John W. Jarve Professor of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, a \nmember of MIT’s McGovern Institute for Brain Research, and the senior \nauthor of the study. “We’ve used a very simple, general model of how \npeople understand other people’s actions, and found that that’s all you \nneed to describe this complex phenomenon.”The findings could have\n implications as the United States prepares for the presidential \nelection taking place on Nov. 5, as they help to reveal the conditions \nthat would be most likely to result in people accepting the election \noutcome.MIT graduate student Setayesh Radkani is the lead author of the paper, which appears today in a special election-themed issue of the journal PNAS Nexus.\n Marika Landau-Wells PhD ’18, a former MIT postdoc who is now an \nassistant professor of political science at the University of California\n at Berkeley, is also an author of the study.Modeling motivationIn\n their work on election debunking, the MIT team took a novel approach, \nbuilding on Saxe’s extensive work studying “theory of mind” — how people\n think about the thoughts and motivations of other people.As part\n of her PhD thesis, Radkani has been developing a computational model of\n the cognitive processes that occur when people see others being \npunished by an authority. Not everyone interprets punitive actions the \nsame way, depending on their previous beliefs about the action and the \nauthority. Some may see the authority as acting legitimately to punish \nan act that was wrong, while others may see an authority overreaching to\n issue an unjust punishment.Last year, after participating in an \nMIT workshop on the topic of polarization in societies, Saxe and Radkani\n had the idea to apply the model to how people react to an authority \nattempting to sway their political beliefs. They enlisted Landau-Wells, \nwho received her PhD in political science before working as a postdoc in\n Saxe’s lab, to join their effort, and Landau suggested applying the \nmodel to debunking of beliefs regarding the legitimacy of an election \nresult.The computational model created by Radkani is based on \nBayesian inference, which allows the model to continually update its \npredictions of people’s beliefs as they receive new information. This \napproach treats debunking as an action that a person undertakes for his \nor her own reasons. People who observe the authority’s statement then \nmake their own interpretation of why the person said what they did. \nBased on that interpretation, people may or may not change their own \nbeliefs about the election result.Additionally, the model does \nnot assume that any beliefs are necessarily incorrect or that any group \nof people is acting irrationally.“The only assumption that we \nmade is that there are two groups in the society that differ in their \nperspectives about a topic: One of them thinks that the election was \nstolen and the other group doesn’t,” Radkani says. “Other than that, \nthese groups are similar. They share their beliefs about the authority —\n what the different motives of the authority are and how motivated the \nauthority is by each of those motives.”The researchers \nmodeled more than 200 different scenarios in which an authority attempts\n to debunk a belief held by one group regarding the validity of an \nelection outcome.Each time they ran the model, the researchers \naltered the certainty levels of each group’s original beliefs, and they \nalso varied the groups’ perceptions of the motivations of the authority.\n In some cases, groups believed the authority was motivated by promoting\n accuracy, and in others they did not. The researchers also altered the \ngroups’ perceptions of whether the authority was biased toward a \nparticular viewpoint, and how strongly the groups believed in those \nperceptions."},

While we cannot compete with silicon as a \nsemiconductor, our idea is not to necessarily replace what is existing, \nbut to push 3D printing technology into uncharted territory. In a \nnutshell, this is really about democratizing technology. This could \nallow anyone to create smart hardware far from traditional manufacturing\n centers,” says Luis Fernando Velásquez-García, a principal research \nscientist in MIT’s Microsystems Technology Laboratories (MTL) and senior\n author of a paper describing the devices, which appears in Virtual and Physical Prototyping.He is joined on the paper by lead author Jorge Cañada, an electrical engineering and computer science graduate student.An unexpected projectSemiconductors,\n including silicon, are materials with electrical properties that can be\n tailored by adding certain impurities. A silicon device can have \nconductive and insulating regions, depending on how it is engineered. \nThese properties make silicon ideal for producing transistors, which are\n a basic building block of modern electronics.However, the researchers didn’t set out to 3D-print semiconductor-free devices that could behave like silicon-based transistors.This\n project grew out of another in which they were fabricating magnetic \ncoils using extrusion printing, a process where the printer melts \nfilament and squirts material through a nozzle, fabricating an object \nlayer-by-layer.They saw an interesting phenomenon in the material they were using, a polymer filament doped with copper nanoparticles.If\n they passed a large amount of electric current into the material, it \nwould exhibit a huge spike in resistance but would return to its \noriginal level shortly after the current flow stopped.This \nproperty enables engineers to make transistors that can operate as \nswitches, something that is typically only associated with silicon and \nother semiconductors. Transistors, which switch on and off to process \nbinary data, are used to form logic gates which perform computation.“We\n saw that this was something that could help take 3D printing hardware \nto the next level. It offers a clear way to provide some degree of \n‘smart’ to an electronic device,” Velásquez-García says.The \nresearchers tried to replicate the same phenomenon with other 3D \nprinting filaments, testing polymers doped with carbon, carbon \nnanotubes, and graphene. In the end, they could not find another \nprintable material that could function as a resettable fuse.They \nhypothesize that the copper particles in the material spread out when it\n is heated by the electric current, which causes a spike in resistance \nthat comes back down when the material cools and the copper particles \nmove closer together. They also think the polymer base of the material \nchanges from crystalline to amorphous when heated, then returns to \ncrystalline when cooled down — a phenomenon known as the polymeric \npositive temperature coefficient.“For now, that is our best \nexplanation, but that is not the full answer because that doesn’t \nexplain why it only happened in this combination of materials.

Advances in technology could \ndemocratize electronics fabrication, making it more accessible. One such\n advancement is the potential of 3D printing technology to create \nsemiconductor-free electronic devices.\nThe Importance of Semiconductors\nControl Electrical Signals: Semiconductors control electrical signals and are central to the functionality of active electronics.Advanced Fabrication: Fabrication requires clean room environments and advanced technologies usually available in specialized manufacturing centers.Pandemic Impact:\n The shortage of semiconductor fabrication facilities during the \npandemic led to a global electronics shortage, impacting economic growth\n and national defense.\nPotential of 3D Printing in Electronics\nWidespread Fabrication:\n Fully 3D-printed active electronic devices could decentralize \nelectronics fabrication, bringing it to businesses, laboratories, and \neven homes worldwide.3D-Printed Resettable Fuses:\n MIT researchers have taken significant steps by demonstrating fully \n3D-printed resettable fuses, which can perform switching functions \ntypically associated with semiconductor-based transistors.\nThe Semiconductors vs. 3D-Printed Devices\nStandard Performance Discrepancy:\n While 3D-printed devices are yet to match the performance of \nsilicon-based transistors, they offer exciting possibilities for basic \ncontrol operations, like regulating motor speed.Democratizing Technology:\n Luis Fernando Velásquez-García emphasized that while the aim isn't to \nreplace existing silicon technology, the objective is to push 3D \nprinting into new realms, democratizing the ability to create smart \nhardware .\nThe Research Journey\nInitial Project:\n The journey began with a project aimed at fabricating magnetic coils \nusing extrusion printing, which involves the deposition of melted \nfilament layer-by-layer.Material Phenomenon:\n In experimenting with polymer filament doped with copper nanoparticles,\n researchers observed a unique phenomenon where the material exhibited a\n significant spike in resistance when subjected to a large electric \ncurrent but returned to its original resistance quickly after.Transistor Functionality:\n This property allowed the creation of transistors functioning as \nswitches, a role traditionally fulfilled by silicon semiconductors .Exploration with Other Materials:\n Researchers tested other printable materials like polymers doped with \ncarbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene but did not observe similar \nfunctionality .\nHypotheses and Observations\nCopper Nanoparticles Effect:\n The researchers hypothesize that heating by electric current causes \ncopper particles within the polymer to spread, increasing resistance, \nwhich decreases when cooled.Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient:\n The polymer's base material may transition from a crystalline to an \namorphous state and back, a behavior known as the polymeric positive \ntemperature coefficient.Need for Further Research:\n Although a definitive explanation eludes them, researchers are \nconfident about the phenomenon's reality and plan to continue their \nexplorations to fully understand it .\nConclusion\nThe advances in 3D printing \ntechnology explored by MIT researchers herald an era where electronics \nfabrication could become decentralized and accessible to a broader range\n of creators.

This simple, inexpensive method could pave the\n way for nearly any biology lab to perform nanoscale imaging.“This\n democratizes imaging,” says Laura Kiessling, the Novartis Professor of \nChemistry at MIT and a member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard \nand MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. “Without this \nmethod, if you want to see things with a high resolution, you have to \nuse very expensive microscopes. What this new technique allows you to do\n is see things that you couldn’t normally see with standard microscopes.\n It drives down the cost of imaging because you can see nanoscale things\n without the need for a specialized facility.”At the resolution \nachieved by this technique, which is around 20 nanometers, scientists \ncan see organelles inside cells, as well as clusters of proteins.“Twenty-fold\n expansion gets you into the realm that biological molecules operate in.\n The building blocks of life are nanoscale things: biomolecules, genes, \nand gene products,” says Edward Boyden, the Y. Eva Tan Professor in \nNeurotechnology at MIT; a professor of biological engineering, media \narts and sciences, and brain and cognitive sciences; a Howard Hughes \nMedical Institute investigator; and a member of MIT’s McGovern Institute\n for Brain Research and Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.Boyden and Kiessling are the senior authors of the new study, which appears today in Nature Methods. MIT graduate student Shiwei Wang and Tay Won Shin PhD ’23 are the lead authors of the paper.A single expansionBoyden’s lab invented expansion microscopy\n in 2015. The technique requires embedding tissue into an absorbent \npolymer and breaking apart the proteins that normally hold tissue \ntogether. When water is added, the gel swells and pulls biomolecules \napart from each other.The original version of this technique, \nwhich expanded tissue about fourfold, allowed researchers to obtain \nimages with a resolution of around 70 nanometers. In 2017, Boyden’s lab \nmodified the process to include a second expansion step, achieving an overall 20-fold expansion. This enables even higher resolution, but the process is more complicated.“We’ve\n developed several 20-fold expansion technologies in the past, but they \nrequire multiple expansion steps,” Boyden says. “If you could do that \namount of expansion in a single step, that could simplify things quite a\n bit.”With 20-fold expansion, researchers can get down to a \nresolution of about 20 nanometers, using a conventional light \nmicroscope. This allows them see cell structures like microtubules and \nmitochondria, as well as clusters of proteins.In the new study, \nthe researchers set out to perform 20-fold expansion with only a single \nstep. This meant that they had to find a gel that was both extremely \nabsorbent and mechanically stable, so that it wouldn’t fall apart when \nexpanded 20-fold.To achieve that, they used a gel assembled from \nN,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMAA) and sodium acrylate. Unlike previous \nexpansion gels that rely on adding another molecule to form crosslinks \nbetween the polymer strands, this gel forms crosslinks spontaneously and\n exhibits strong mechanical properties. Such gel components previously \nhad been used in expansion microscopy protocols, but the resulting gels \ncould expand only about tenfold. The MIT team optimized the gel and the \npolymerization process to make the gel more robust, and to allow for \n20-fold expansion.To further stabilize the gel and enhance its \nreproducibility, the researchers removed oxygen from the polymer \nsolution prior to gelation, which prevents side reactions that interfere\n with crosslinking. This step requires running nitrogen gas through the \npolymer solution, which replaces most of the oxygen in the system.Once\n the gel is formed, select bonds in the proteins that hold the tissue \ntogether are broken and water is added to make the gel expand. After the\n expansion is performed, target proteins in tissue can be labeled and \nimaged.“This approach may require more sample preparation \ncompared to other super-resolution techniques, but it’s much simpler \nwhen it comes to the actual imaging process, especially for 3D imaging,”\n Shin says. “We document the step-by-step protocol in the manuscript so \nthat readers can go through it easily.”"},

    {text: "input: A growing portion of Americans who are struggling to pay for their \nhousehold energy live in the South and Southwest, reflecting a \nclimate-driven shift away from heating needs and toward air conditioning\n use, an MIT study finds.The newly published research also \nreveals that a major U.S. federal program that provides energy subsidies\n to households, by assigning block grants to states, does not yet fully \nmatch these recent trends.The work evaluates the “energy burden” \non households, which reflects the percentage of income needed to pay for\n energy necessities, from 2015 to 2020. Households with an energy burden\n greater than 6 percent of income are considered to be in “energy \npoverty.” With climate change, rising temperatures are expected to add \nfinancial stress in the South, where air conditioning is increasingly \nneeded. Meanwhile, milder winters are expected to reduce heating costs \nin some colder regions.“From 2015 to 2020, there is an increase \nin burden generally, and you do also see this southern shift,” says \nChristopher Knittel, an MIT energy economist and co-author of a new \npaper detailing the study’s results. About federal aid, he adds, “When \nyou compare the distribution of the energy burden to where the money is \ngoing, it’s not aligned too well.”The paper, “U.S. federal resource allocations are inconsistent with concentrations of energy poverty,” is published today in Science Advances.The\n authors are Carlos Batlle, a professor at Comillas University in Spain \nand a senior lecturer with the MIT Energy Initiative; Peter Heller SM \n’24, a recent graduate of the MIT Technology and Policy Program; \nKnittel, the George P. Shultz Professor at the MIT Sloan School of \nManagement and associate dean for climate and sustainability at MIT; and\n Tim Schittekatte, a senior lecturer at MIT Sloan.A scorching decadeThe\n study, which grew out of graduate research that Heller conducted at \nMIT, deploys a machine-learning estimation technique that the scholars \napplied to U.S. energy use data.Specifically, the researchers \ntook a sample of about 20,000 households from the U.S. Energy \nInformation Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption Survey, \nwhich includes a wide variety of demographic characteristics about \nresidents, along with building-type and geographic information. Then, \nusing the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey data for 2015 \nand 2020, the research team estimated the average household energy \nburden for every census tract in the lower 48 states — 73,057 in 2015, \nand 84,414 in 2020.That allowed the researchers to chart the \nchanges in energy burden in recent years, including the shift toward a \ngreater energy burden in southern states. In 2015, Maine, Mississippi, \nArkansas, Vermont, and Alabama were the five states (ranked in \ndescending order) with the highest energy burden across census bureau \ntracts. In 2020, that had shifted somewhat, with Maine and Vermont \ndropping on the list and southern states increasingly having a larger \nenergy burden. That year, the top five states in descending order were \nMississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, West Virginia, and Maine.The data\n also reflect a urban-rural shift. In 2015, 23 percent of the census \ntracts where the average household is living in energy poverty were \nurban. That figure shrank to 14 percent by 2020.All told, the \ndata are consistent with the picture of a warming world, in which milder\n winters in the North, Northwest, and Mountain West require less heating\n fuel, while more extreme summer temperatures in the South require more \nair conditioning.“Who’s going to be harmed most from climate \nchange?” asks Knittel. “In the U.S., not surprisingly, it’s going to be \nthe southern part of the U.S. And our study is confirming that, but also\n suggesting it’s the southern part of the U.S that’s least able to \nrespond.

    {text: "output: The Shifting Landscape of Energy Poverty in the United States\nIntroduction\nEnergy poverty, defined as the \nsituation where households spend more than 6% of their income on energy \nneeds, has been a significant issue in the United States. This \nphenomenon has gained more attention due to rising temperatures \nassociated with climate change, particularly affecting the southern \nstates where air conditioning is increasingly essential. This analysis \nsynthesizes information from recent research to provide a comprehensive \nview of the trends and challenges associated with energy poverty in the \nU.S.\nClimate Change and Energy Burden\nKey Findings\nIncreased Energy Burden in the South:\n From 2015 to 2020, there has been a noticeable shift in energy burden \ntoward the southern states of the U.S. This shift reflects the \nincreasing need for air conditioning due to rising temperatures.Federal Aid Mismatch:\n The current distribution of federal aid, in the form of energy \nsubsidies to households, does not align well with the regions \nexperiencing the highest energy burdens.\nEstimation Techniques\nMachine Learning Application:\n The study utilizes a machine-learning estimation technique on U.S. \nenergy use data. A sample of about 20,000 households from the U.S. \nEnergy Information Administration’s Residential Energy Consumption \nSurvey was analyzed to estimate energy burden across census tracts.\nData Analysis\nCensus Data Integration:\n Researchers integrated data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American \nCommunity Survey for 2015 and 2020 to estimate household energy burdens \nacross over 73,000 census tracts in 2015 and over 84,000 in 2020.Urban vs. Rural Shift:\n Data indicated a shift from urban to rural areas in terms of energy \npoverty. In 2015, 23% of the census tracts with significant energy \npoverty were urban, decreasing to 14% by 2020.\nGeographic Trends and Energy Poverty\nTop Affected States\n2015: Maine, Mississippi, Arkansas, Vermont, and Alabama were the states with the highest energy burdens.2020:\n The most affected states shifted to primarily southern ones, including \nMississippi, Arkansas, Alabama, West Virginia, and Maine being the \noutlier from the colder regions.\nImplications of Climate Change\nHeating vs. Cooling Needs:\n The North and colder regions are experiencing milder winters, reducing \nheating costs. Conversely, the South is facing more extreme summer \ntemperatures, driving up the need for air conditioning and, \nconsequently, energy costs.Vulnerability to Climate Change:\n Southern parts of the U.S. are the most burdened by energy costs and \nalso the least capable of adapting financially to rising temperatures.\nPolicy Recommendations\nRealignment of Federal Aid\nAdjustment to Current Trends:\n Given the shifting energy burdens, a realignment of federal energy \nsubsidies is necessary. Aid should be reassigned to reflect the states \nand regions most affected by rising energy costs due to climate change.\nInclusive Policies\nUrban and Rural Focus: Policies should address both urban and rural areas, taking into account the distinct energy needs and vulnerabilities.\nConclusion\nEnergy poverty is a growing \nconcern, particularly in the southern United States, as climate change \nexacerbates the demand for air conditioning. Current federal aid \nprograms need to be reassessed and realigned to more effectively support\n the regions and households experiencing the highest energy burdens. \nThis will require a data-driven approach and policy innovation to ensure\n all Americans can maintain adequate living conditions in a changing \nclimate.\n\nBy understanding and addressing \nthese key points, policymakers, researchers, and the public can work \ntowards mitigating the impacts of energy poverty exacerbated by climate \nchange ."},
    {text: "input: Mars wasn’t always the cold desert we see today. There’s \nincreasing evidence that water once flowed on the Red Planet’s surface, \nbillions of years ago. And if there was water, there must also have been\n a thick atmosphere to keep that water from freezing. But sometime \naround 3.5 billion years ago, the water dried up, and the air, once \nheavy with carbon dioxide, dramatically thinned, leaving only the wisp \nof an atmosphere that clings to the planet today.Where exactly did Mars’ atmosphere go? This question has been a central mystery of Mars’ 4.6-billion-year history.For two MIT geologists, the answer may lie in the planet’s clay. In a paper appearing today in Science Advances, they propose that much of Mars’ missing atmosphere could be locked up in the planet’s clay-covered crust.The\n team makes the case that, while water was present on Mars, the liquid \ncould have trickled through certain rock types and set off a slow chain \nof reactions that progressively drew carbon dioxide out of the \natmosphere and converted it into methane — a form of carbon that could \nbe stored for eons in the planet’s clay surface.Similar processes\n occur in some regions on Earth. The researchers used their knowledge of\n interactions between rocks and gases on Earth and applied that to how \nsimilar processes could play out on Mars. They found that, given how \nmuch clay is estimated to cover Mars’ surface, the planet’s clay could \nhold up to 1.7 bar of carbon dioxide, which would be equivalent to \naround 80 percent of the planet’s initial, early atmosphere.It’s \npossible that this sequestered Martian carbon could one day be recovered\n and converted into propellant to fuel future missions between Mars and \nEarth, the researchers propose.“Based on our findings on Earth, \nwe show that similar processes likely operated on Mars, and that copious\n amounts of atmospheric CO2 could have transformed to methane\n and been sequestered in clays,” says study author Oliver Jagoutz, \nprofessor of geology in MIT’s Department of Earth, Atmospheric and \nPlanetary Sciences (EAPS). “This methane could still be present and \nmaybe even used as an energy source on Mars in the future.”The study’s lead author is recent EAPS graduate Joshua Murray PhD ’24.In the foldsJagoutz’\n group at MIT seeks to identify the geologic processes and interactions \nthat drive the evolution of Earth’s lithosphere — the hard and brittle \nouter layer that includes the crust and upper mantle, where tectonic \nplates lie.In 2023, he and Murray focused on a type of surface \nclay mineral called smectite, which is known to be a highly effective \ntrap for carbon. Within a single grain of smectite are a multitude of \nfolds, within which carbon can sit undisturbed for billions of years. \nThey showed that smectite on Earth was likely a product of tectonic \nactivity, and that, once exposed at the surface, the clay minerals acted\n to draw down and store enough carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to \ncool the planet over millions of years.Soon after the team reported their results,\n Jagoutz happened to look at a map of the surface of Mars and realized \nthat much of that planet’s surface was covered in the same smectite \nclays. Could the clays have had a similar carbon-trapping effect on \nMars, and if so, how much carbon could the clays hold?“We know \nthis process happens, and it is well-documented on Earth. And these \nrocks and clays exist on Mars,” Jagoutz says. “So, we wanted to try and \nconnect the dots.”“Every nook and cranny”Unlike\n on Earth, where smectite is a consequence of continental plates \nshifting and uplifting to bring rocks from the mantle to the surface, \nthere is no such tectonic activity on Mars. The team looked for ways in \nwhich the clays could have formed on Mars, based on what scientists know\n of the planet’s history and composition.For instance, some \nremote measurements of Mars’ surface suggest that at least part of the \nplanet’s crust contains ultramafic igneous rocks, similar to those that \nproduce smectites through weathering on Earth. Other observations reveal\n geologic patterns similar to terrestrial rivers and tributaries, where \nwater could have flowed and reacted with the underlying rock.Jagoutz\n and Murray wondered whether water could have reacted with Mars’ deep \nultramafic rocks in a way that would produce the clays that cover the \nsurface today. They developed a simple model of rock chemistry, based on\n what is known of how igneous rocks interact with their environment on \nEarth.They applied this model to Mars, where scientists believe \nthe crust is mostly made up of igneous rock that is rich in the mineral \nolivine. The team used the model to estimate the changes that \nolivine-rich rock might undergo, assuming that water existed on the \nsurface for at least a billion years, and the atmosphere was thick with \ncarbon dioxide.“At this time in Mars’ history, we think CO2 is everywhere, in every nook and cranny, and water percolating through the rocks is full of CO2 too,” Murray says.Over\n about a billion years, water trickling through the crust would have \nslowly reacted with olivine — a mineral that is rich in a reduced form \nof iron. Oxygen molecules in water would have bound to the iron, \nreleasing hydrogen as a result and forming the red oxidized iron which \ngives the planet its iconic color. This free hydrogen would then have \ncombined with carbon dioxide in the water, to form methane. As this \nreaction progressed over time, olivine would have slowly transformed \ninto another type of iron-rich rock known as serpentine, which then \ncontinued to react with water to form smectite.“These smectite \nclays have so much capacity to store carbon,” Murray says. “So then we \nused existing knowledge of how these minerals are stored in clays on \nEarth, and extrapolate to say, if the Martian surface has this much clay\n in it, how much methane can you store in those clays?”He and \nJagoutz found that if Mars is covered in a layer of smectite that is \n1,100 meters deep, this amount of clay could store a huge amount of \nmethane, equivalent to most of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that\n is thought to have disappeared since the planet dried up.“We find that estimates of global clay volumes on Mars are consistent with a significant fraction of Mars’ initial CO2\n being sequestered as organic compounds within the clay-rich crust,” \nMurray says. “In some ways, Mars’ missing atmosphere could be hiding in \nplain sight.”“Where the CO2 went from an early, \nthicker atmosphere is a fundamental question in the history of the Mars \natmosphere, its climate, and the habitability by microbes,” says Bruce \nJakosky, professor emeritus of geology at the University of Colorado \nand principal investigator on the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution\n (MAVEN) mission, which has been orbiting and studying Mars’ upper \natmosphere since 2014. Jakosky was not involved with the current \nstudy. “Murray and Jagoutz examine the chemical interaction of rocks \nwith the atmosphere as a means of removing CO2. At the high end of our \nestimates of how much weathering has occurred, this could be a major \nprocess in removing CO2 from Mars’ early atmosphere.”This work was supported, in part, by the National Science Foundation."},

All this builds into our idea of a \nsustainable, circular building material.”“Glass as a structural \nmaterial kind of breaks people’s brains a little bit,” says Michael \nStern, a former MIT graduate student and researcher in both MIT’s Media \nLab and Lincoln Laboratory, who is also founder and director of \nEvenline. “We’re showing this is an opportunity to push the limits of \nwhat’s been done in architecture.”Becker and Stern, with their colleagues, detail their glass brick design in a study appearing today in the journal Glass Structures and Engineering. Their MIT co-authors include lead author Daniel Massimino and Charlotte Folinus, along with Ethan Townsend at Evenline.Lock stepThe\n inspiration for the new circular masonry design arose partly in MIT’s \nGlass Lab, where Becker and Stern, then undergraduate students, first \nlearned the art and science of blowing glass.“I found the \nmaterial fascinating,” says Stern, who later designed a 3D printer \ncapable of printing molten recycled glass — a project he took on while \nstudying in the mechanical engineering department. “I started thinking \nof how glass printing can find its place and do interesting things, \nconstruction being one possible route.”Meanwhile, Becker, who \naccepted a faculty position at MIT, began exploring the intersection of \nmanufacturing and design, and ways to develop new processes that enable \ninnovative designs.“I get excited about expanding design and \nmanfucaturing spaces for challenging materials with interesting \ncharacteristics, like glass and its optical properties and \nrecyclability,” Becker says. “As long as it’s not contaminated, you can \nrecycle glass almost infinitely.”She and Stern teamed up to see \nwhether and how 3D-printable glass could be made into a structural \nmasonry unit as sturdy and stackable as traditional bricks. For their \nnew study, the team used the Glass 3D Printer 3 (G3DP3), the latest \nversion of Evenline’s glass printer, which pairs with a furnace to melt \ncrushed glass bottles into a molten, printable form that the printer \nthen deposits in layered patterns.The team printed prototype \nglass bricks using soda-lime glass that is typically used in a \nglassblowing studio. They incorporated two round pegs onto each printed \nbrick, similar to the studs on a LEGO brick. Like the toy blocks, the \npegs enable bricks to interlock and assemble into larger structures. \nAnother material placed between the bricks prevent scratches or cracks \nbetween glass surfaces but can be removed if a brick structure were to \nbe dismantled and recycled, also allowing bricks to be remelted in the \nprinter and formed into new shapes. The team decided to make the blocks \ninto a figure-eight shape.“With the figure-eight shape, we can \nconstrain the bricks while also assembling them into walls that have \nsome curvature,” Massimino says."},

Intriguingly, some of\n these carbohydrate proteins can also collaborate to direct immune \nresponses. This work presents a strategy for targeting those antigens to\n the dendritic cells that results in a more activated, stronger immune \nresponse.Tackling tumors’ tenacityThe\n researchers’ new strategy shrouds the tumor antigens with foreign \ncarbohydrates and co-delivers them with single-stranded RNA so that the \ndendritic cells can be programmed to recognize the tumor antigens as a \npotential threat. The researchers targeted the lectin \n(carbohydrate-binding protein) DC-SIGN because of its ability to serve \nas an activator of dendritic cell immunity. They decorated a virus-like \nparticle (a particle composed of virus proteins assembled onto a piece \nof RNA that is noninfectious because its internal RNA is not from the \nvirus) with DC-binding carbohydrate derivatives. The resulting \nglycan-costumed virus-like particles display unique sugars; therefore, \nthe dendritic cells recognize them as something they need to attack.“On\n the surface of the dendritic cells are carbohydrate binding proteins \ncalled lectins that combine to the sugars on the surface of bacteria or \nviruses, and when they do that they penetrate the membrane,” explains \nKiessling, the paper’s senior author. “On the cell, the DC-SIGN gets \nclustered upon binding the virus or bacteria and that promotes \ninternalization. When a virus-like particle gets internalized, it starts\n to fall apart and releases its RNA.” The toll-like receptor (bound to \nRNA) and DC-SIGN (bound to the sugar decoration) can both signal to \nactivate the immune response.Once the dendritic cells \nhave sounded the alarm of a foreign invasion, a robust immune response \nis triggered that is significantly stronger than the immune response \nthat would be expected with a typical untargeted vaccine. When an \nantigen is encountered by the dendritic cells, they send signals to T \ncells, the next cell in the immune system, to give different responses \ndepending on what pathways have been activated in the dendritic cells.Advancing cancer vaccine developmentThe\n activity of a potential vaccine developed in line with this new \nresearch is twofold. First, the vaccine glycan coat binds to lectins, \nproviding a primary signal. Then, binding to toll-like receptors elicits\n potent immune activation.The Kiessling, Finn, and \nJohnson groups had previously identified a synthetic DC-SIGN binding \ngroup that directed cellular immune responses when used to decorate \nvirus-like particles. But it was unclear whether this method could be \nutilized as an anticancer vaccine. Collaboration between researchers in \nthe labs at MIT and Georgia Tech demonstrated that in fact, it could.Valerie\n Lensch, a chemistry PhD student from MIT’s Program in Polymers and Soft\n Matter and a joint member of the Kiessling and Johnson labs, took the \npreexisting strategy and tested it as an anticancer vaccine, learning a \ngreat deal about immunology in order to do so.“We have \ndeveloped a modular vaccine platform designed to drive antigen-specific \ncellular immune responses,” says Lensch. “This platform is not only \npivotal in the fight against cancer, but also offers significant \npotential for combating challenging intracellular pathogens, including \nmalaria parasites, HIV, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This \ntechnology holds promise for tackling a range of diseases where vaccine \ndevelopment has been particularly challenging.”Lensch \nand her fellow researchers conducted in vitro experiments with extensive\n iterations of these glycan-costumed virus-like particles before \nidentifying a design that demonstrated potential for success. Once that \nwas achieved, the researchers were able to move on to an in vivo model, \nan exciting milestone for their research.Adele Gabba, a\n postdoc in the Kiessling Lab, conducted the in vivo experiments with \nLensch, and Robert Hincapie, who conducted his PhD studies with \nProfessor M.G. Finn at Georgia Tech, built and decorated the virus-like \nparticles with a series of glycans that were sent to him from the \nresearchers at MIT.“We are discovering that \ncarbohydrates act like a language that cells use to communicate and \ndirect the immune system,” says Gabba. “It's thrilling that we have \nbegun to decode this language and can now harness it to reshape immune \nresponses.”“The design principles behind this vaccine \nare rooted in extensive fundamental research conducted by previous \ngraduate student and postdoctoral researchers over many years, focusing \non optimizing lectin engagement and understanding the roles of lectins \nin immunity,” says Lensch. “It has been exciting to witness the \ntranslation of these concepts into therapeutic platforms across various \napplications.”"},

    {text: "input: To the untrained eye, a medical image like an MRI or X-ray appears to be a\n murky collection of black-and-white blobs. It can be a struggle to \ndecipher where one structure (like a tumor) ends and another begins. When\n trained to understand the boundaries of biological structures, AI \nsystems can segment (or delineate) regions of interest that doctors and \nbiomedical workers want to monitor for diseases and other abnormalities.\n Instead of losing precious time tracing anatomy by hand across many \nimages, an artificial assistant could do that for them.The \ncatch? Researchers and clinicians must label countless images to train \ntheir AI system before it can accurately segment. For example, you’d \nneed to annotate the cerebral cortex in numerous MRI scans to train a \nsupervised model to understand how the cortex’s shape can vary in \ndifferent brains.Sidestepping such tedious data collection, \nresearchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence \nLaboratory (CSAIL), Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and Harvard \nMedical School have developed the interactive “ScribblePrompt” framework: a flexible tool that can help rapidly segment any medical image, even types it hasn’t seen before. Instead\n of having humans mark up each picture manually, the team simulated how \nusers would annotate over 50,000 scans, including MRIs, ultrasounds, and\n photographs, across structures in the eyes, cells, brains, bones, skin,\n and more. To label all those scans, the team used algorithms to \nsimulate how humans would scribble and click on different regions in \nmedical images. In addition to commonly labeled regions, the team also \nused superpixel algorithms, which find parts of the image with similar \nvalues, to identify potential new regions of interest to medical \nresearchers and train ScribblePrompt to segment them. This synthetic \ndata prepared ScribblePrompt to handle real-world segmentation requests \nfrom users.“AI has significant potential in analyzing images and\n other high-dimensional data to help humans do things more \nproductively,” says MIT PhD student Hallee Wong SM ’22, the lead author \non a new paper about ScribblePrompt\n and a CSAIL affiliate. “We want to augment, not replace, the efforts of\n medical workers through an interactive system. ScribblePrompt is a \nsimple model with the efficiency to help doctors focus on the more \ninteresting parts of their analysis. It’s faster and more accurate than \ncomparable interactive segmentation methods, reducing annotation time by\n 28 percent compared to Meta’s Segment Anything Model (SAM) framework, \nfor example.”ScribblePrompt’s interface is simple: \nUsers can scribble across the rough area they’d like segmented, or click\n on it, and the tool will highlight the entire structure or background \nas requested. For example, you can click on individual veins within a \nretinal (eye) scan. ScribblePrompt can also mark up a structure given a \nbounding box.Then, the tool can make corrections based on the \nuser’s feedback. If you wanted to highlight a kidney in an ultrasound, \nyou could use a bounding box, and then scribble in additional parts of \nthe structure if ScribblePrompt missed any edges. If you wanted to edit \nyour segment, you could use a “negative scribble” to exclude certain \nregions.These self-correcting, interactive capabilities\n made ScribblePrompt the preferred tool among neuroimaging researchers \nat MGH in a user study. 93.8 percent of these users favored the MIT \napproach over the SAM baseline in improving its segments in response to \nscribble corrections. As for click-based edits, 87.5 percent of the \nmedical researchers preferred ScribblePrompt.ScribblePrompt was \ntrained on simulated scribbles and clicks on 54,000 images across 65 \ndatasets, featuring scans of the eyes, thorax, spine, cells, skin, \nabdominal muscles, neck, brain, bones, teeth, and lesions. The model \nfamiliarized itself with 16 types of medical images, including \nmicroscopies, CT scans, X-rays, MRIs, ultrasounds, and photographs.“Many\n existing methods don't respond well when users scribble across images \nbecause it’s hard to simulate such interactions in training. For \nScribblePrompt, we were able to force our model to pay attention to \ndifferent inputs using our synthetic segmentation tasks,” says Wong. “We\n wanted to train what’s essentially a foundation model on a lot of \ndiverse data so it would generalize to new types of images and tasks.”After\n taking in so much data, the team evaluated ScribblePrompt across 12 new\n datasets. Although it hadn’t seen these images before, it outperformed \nfour existing methods by segmenting more efficiently and giving more \naccurate predictions about the exact regions users wanted highlighted.“​​Segmentation\n is the most prevalent biomedical image analysis task, performed widely \nboth in routine clinical practice and in research — which leads to it \nbeing both very diverse and a crucial, impactful step,” says senior \nauthor Adrian Dalca SM ’12, PhD ’16, CSAIL research scientist and \nassistant professor at MGH and Harvard Medical School. “ScribblePrompt \nwas carefully designed to be practically useful to clinicians and \nresearchers, and hence to substantially make this step much, much \nfaster.”“The majority of segmentation algorithms that have been \ndeveloped in image analysis and machine learning are at least to some \nextent based on our ability to manually annotate images,” says Harvard \nMedical School professor in radiology and MGH neuroscientist Bruce \nFischl, who was not involved in the paper. “The problem is dramatically \nworse in medical imaging in which our ‘images’ are typically 3D volumes,\n as human beings have no evolutionary or phenomenological reason to have\n any competency in annotating 3D images. ScribblePrompt enables manual \nannotation to be carried out much, much faster and more accurately, by \ntraining a network on precisely the types of interactions a human would \ntypically have with an image while manually annotating. The result is an\n intuitive interface that allows annotators to naturally interact with \nimaging data with far greater productivity than was previously \npossible.”Wong and Dalca wrote the paper with two other CSAIL \naffiliates: John Guttag, the Dugald C. Jackson Professor of EECS at MIT \nand CSAIL principal investigator; and MIT PhD student Marianne Rakic SM \n’22.

    {text: "input: The idea of electrically stimulating a brain region \ncalled the central thalamus has gained traction among researchers and \nclinicians because it can help arouse subjects from unconscious states \ninduced by traumatic brain injury or anesthesia, and can boost cognition\n and performance in awake animals. But the method, called CT-DBS, can \nhave a side effect: seizures. A new study by researchers at MIT and \nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH) who were testing the method in \nawake mice quantifies the probability of seizures at different \nstimulation currents and cautions that they sometimes occurred even at \nlow levels.“Understanding production and prevalence of this type \nof seizure activity is important because brain stimulation-based \ntherapies are becoming more widely used,” says co-senior author Emery N.\n Brown, Edward Hood Taplin Professor of Medical Engineering and \nComputational Neuroscience in The Picower Institute for Learning and \nMemory, the Institute for Medical Engineering and Science, the \nDepartment of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and the Center for Brains \nMinds and Machines (CBMM) at MIT.In the brain, the seizures \nassociated with CT-DBS occur as “electrographic seizures,” which are \nbursts of voltage among neurons across a broad spectrum of frequencies. \nBehaviorally, they manifest as “absence seizures” in which the subject \nappears to take on a blank stare and freezes for about 10-20 seconds.In\n their study, the researchers were hoping to determine a CT-DBS \nstimulation current — in a clinically relevant range of under 200 \nmicroamps — below which seizures could be reliably avoided.In \nsearch of that ideal current, they developed a protocol of starting \nbrief bouts of CT-DBS at 1 microamp and then incrementally ramping the \ncurrent up to 200 microamps until they found a threshold where an \nelectrographic seizure occurred. Once they found that threshold, then \nthey tested a longer bout of stimulation at the next lowest current \nlevel in hopes that an electrographic seizure wouldn’t occur. They did \nthis for a variety of different stimulation frequencies. To their \nsurprise, electrographic seizures still occurred 2.2 percent of the time\n during those longer stimulation trials (i.e. 22 times out of 996 tests)\n and in 10 out of 12 mice. At just 20 microamps, mice still experienced \nseizures in three out of 244 tests, a 1.2 percent rate.“This is \nsomething that we needed to report because this was really surprising,” \nsays co-lead author Francisco Flores, a research affiliate in The \nPicower Institute and CBMM, and an instructor in anesthesiology at MGH, \nwhere Brown is also an anesthesiologist. Isabella Dalla Betta, a \ntechnical associate in The Picower Institute, co-led the study published\n in Brain Stimulation.Stimulation\n frequency didn’t matter for seizure risk but the rate of electrographic\n seizures increased as the current level increased. For instance, it \nhappened in 5 out of 190 tests at 50 microamps, and two out of 65 tests \nat 100 microamps. The researchers also found that when an electrographic\n seizure occurred, it did so more quickly at higher currents than at \nlower levels. Finally, they also saw that seizures happened more quickly\n if they stimulated the thalamus on both sides of the brain, versus just\n one side. Some mice exhibited behaviors similar to absence seizure, \nthough others became hyperactive.It is not clear why some mice \nexperienced electrographic seizures at just 20 microamps while two mice \ndid not experience the seizures even at 200. Flores speculated that \nthere may be different brain states that change the predisposition to \nseizures amid stimulation of the thalamus. Notably, seizures are not \ntypically observed in humans who receive CT-DBS while in a minimally \nconscious state after a traumatic brain injury or in animals who are \nunder anesthesia. Flores said the next stage of the research would aim \nto discern what the relevant brain states may be.In the meantime,\n the study authors wrote, “EEG should be closely monitored for \nelectrographic seizures when performing CT-DBS, especially in awake \nsubjects.”The paper’s co-senior author is Matt Wilson, Sherman \nFairchild Professor in The Picower Institute, CBMM, and the departments \nof Biology and Brain and Cognitive Sciences.

    {text: "output: Exploring the Implications and Risks of Central Thalamic Deep Brain Stimulation (CT-DBS)\nIntroduction\nCentral thalamic deep brain \nstimulation (CT-DBS) is being scrutinized for its potential to help \npatients recover from unconscious states induced by traumatic brain \ninjuries or anesthesia. It can also enhance cognitive functions in awake\n animals. The technique, however, carries a risk of inducing seizures, \nparticularly electrographic seizures characterized by bursts of neuronal\n voltage activity.\nKey Concepts:\nCT-DBS: A method of brain stimulation targeting the central thalamus.Electrographic Seizures: Neuroelectrical events marked by sudden bursts of voltage across neurons.Absence Seizures: Seizures where the subject appears to have a blank stare, often freezing for a short duration.\nThe Study\nObjective\nTo determine a safe CT-DBS \nstimulation current level that minimizes the risk of seizures, focusing \non currents under 200 microamps.\nMethodology\nResearchers at MIT and \nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH) conducted a study on awake mice. \nThey started with a low current of 1 microamp and increased it \nincrementally up to 200 microamps. They sought to identify the highest \ncurrent that did not trigger seizures, then tested this threshold during\n extended stimulation trials.\nFindings\nFrequency Irrelevant: Seizure risk did not correlate with the frequency of stimulation.Correlation with Current: Higher current levels increased seizure rates.\n50 Microamps: Seizures occurred in 5 out of 190 tests.100 Microamps: Seizures occurred in 2 out of 65 tests.\nThreshold Surprises: Despite careful adjustments, mice still experienced seizures at lower currents:\n20 Microamps: Seizures occurred in 3 out of 244 tests.\nSymmetry Factor: Seizures manifested more quickly if both sides of the thalamus were stimulated.\nBehavioral Observations\nWhile some mice displayed typical absence seizure behaviors, others exhibited hyperactivity.\nIndividual Variability\nNot all mice responded similarly\n to stimulation; some experienced seizures at much lower currents, while\n a few did not experience seizures even at higher currents. This \nsuggests that individual brain states could influence seizures.\nRecommendations and Future Directions\nClinical Precautions\nClose Monitoring: Researchers recommend close EEG monitoring for electrographic seizures during CT-DBS, especially in awake subjects.\nFuture Research Focus\nThe next phase of research will \naim to identify the brain states that affect seizure susceptibility \nduring thalamic stimulation.

    {text: "input: Typically, electrons are free agents that can move through most \nmetals in any direction. When they encounter an obstacle, the charged \nparticles experience friction and scatter randomly like colliding \nbilliard balls.But in certain exotic materials, electrons can \nappear to flow with single-minded purpose. In these materials, electrons\n may become locked to the material’s edge and flow in one direction, \nlike ants marching single-file along a blanket’s boundary. In this rare \n“edge state,” electrons can flow without friction, gliding effortlessly \naround obstacles as they stick to their perimeter-focused flow. Unlike \nin a superconductor, where all electrons in a material flow without \nresistance, the current carried by edge modes occurs only at a \nmaterial’s boundary.Now MIT physicists have directly observed \nedge states in a cloud of ultracold atoms. For the first time, the team \nhas captured images of atoms flowing along a boundary without \nresistance, even as obstacles are placed in their path. The results, \nwhich appear today in Nature Physics,\n could help physicists manipulate electrons to flow without friction in \nmaterials that could enable super-efficient, lossless transmission of \nenergy and data.“You could imagine making little pieces of a \nsuitable material and putting it inside future devices, so electrons \ncould shuttle along the edges and between different parts of your \ncircuit without any loss,” says study co-author Richard Fletcher, \nassistant professor of physics at MIT. “I would stress though that, for \nus, the beauty is seeing with your own eyes physics which is absolutely \nincredible but usually hidden away in materials and unable to be viewed \ndirectly.”The study’s co-authors at MIT include graduate students\n Ruixiao Yao and Sungjae Chi, former graduate students Biswaroop \nMukherjee PhD ’20 and Airlia Shaffer PhD ’23, along with Martin \nZwierlein, the Thomas A. Frank Professor of Physics. The co-authors are \nall members of MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics and the \nMIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms.Forever on the edgePhysicists\n first invoked the idea of edge states to explain a curious phenomenon, \nknown today as the Quantum Hall effect, which scientists first observed \nin 1980, in experiments with layered materials, where electrons were \nconfined to two dimensions. These experiments were performed in \nultracold conditions, and under a magnetic field. When scientists tried \nto send a current through these materials, they observed that electrons \ndid not flow straight through the material, but instead accumulated on \none side, in precise quantum portions.To try and explain this \nstrange phenomenon, physicists came up with the idea that these Hall \ncurrents are carried by edge states. They proposed that, under a \nmagnetic field, electrons in an applied current could be deflected to \nthe edges of a material, where they would flow and accumulate in a way \nthat might explain the initial observations.“The way charge \nflows under a magnetic field suggests there must be edge modes,” \nFletcher says. “But to actually see them is quite a special thing \nbecause these states occur over femtoseconds, and across fractions of a \nnanometer, which is incredibly difficult to capture.”Rather than \ntry and catch electrons in an edge state, Fletcher and his colleagues \nrealized they might be able to recreate the same physics in a larger and\n more observable system. The team has been studying the behavior of \nultracold atoms in a carefully designed setup that mimics the physics of\n electrons under a magnetic field.“In our setup, the same physics\n occurs in atoms, but over milliseconds and microns,” Zwierlein \nexplains. “That means that we can take images and watch the atoms crawl \nessentially forever along the edge of the system.”"},
    {text: "output: Observing Edge States in Ultracold Atoms\nIntroduction\nRecent advancements in the field\n of condensed matter physics have led to the direct observation of edge \nstates in ultracold atoms by MIT physicists. These edge states were \nwitnessed using a carefully controlled setup that mimics the physics of \nelectrons under a magnetic field. The significance of this discovery \nlies in the potential to manipulate electron flow without friction, \nwhich can lead to super-efficient, lossless transmission of energy and \ndata.\nBackground\nFree Agency of Electrons\nTypically, electrons move freely through most metals, scattering randomly when they encounter obstacles.In certain exotic materials, electrons flow with purpose, sticking to material edges and moving unidirectionally.This edge state is different from superconductivity, where electrons move without resistance through the entire material.\nDiscovery by MIT Physicists\nCondensed Matter Breakthrough\nMIT physicists have successfully observed edge states within a cloud\n of ultracold atoms, imaging atoms flowing along a boundary without \nresistance.This observation was published in Nature Physics and could revolutionize current electronic device designs by allowing frictionless electron flow in circuits.\nHistorical Context\nQuantum Hall Effect\nIdentified in 1980 during experiments with layered materials subjected to ultracold conditions and a magnetic field.Electrons in these experiments accumulated at one side of the \nmaterial in precise portions, a phenomenon theorized to be due to edge \nstates.These edge states were challenging to observe directly due to their fleeting existence over femtoseconds and nanometers.\nResearch Methodology\nUltracold Atoms Setup\nInstead of capturing elusive electrons, researchers recreated the physics using ultracold atoms.This method allows the observation of atomic behavior over longer \nperiods (milliseconds) and larger scales (microns), offering better \nvisibility and analysis capabilities.\nImplications for Future Devices\nThis discovery suggests the possibility of integrating suitable \nmaterials into future devices, which would leverage edge state electron \nflow for efficient, lossless energy and data transfer.\nResearch Team\nThe study was conducted by MIT’s Research Laboratory of Electronics \nand the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms, with key contributors \nincluding graduate students and professors.\nConclusion\nThe direct observation of edge \nstates in ultracold atoms marks a significant milestone in condensed \nmatter physics.

    {text: "input: Collagen, a protein found in bones and connective tissue,\n has been found in dinosaur fossils as old as 195 million years. That \nfar exceeds the normal half-life of the peptide bonds that hold proteins\n together, which is about 500 years.A new study from MIT offers \nan explanation for how collagen can survive for so much longer than \nexpected. The research team found that a special atomic-level \ninteraction defends collagen from attack by water molecules. This \nbarricade prevents water from breaking the peptide bonds through a \nprocess called hydrolysis.“We provide evidence that that \ninteraction prevents water from attacking the peptide bonds and cleaving\n them. That just flies in the face of what happens with a normal peptide\n bond, which has a half-life of only 500 years,” says Ron Raines, the \nFirmenich Professor of Chemistry at MIT.Raines is the senior author of the new study, which appears today in ACS Central Science.\n MIT postdoc Jinyi Yang PhD ’24 is the lead author of the paper. MIT \npostdoc Volga Kojasoy and graduate student Gerard Porter are also \nauthors of the study.Water-resistantCollagen\n is the most abundant protein in animals, and it is found in not only \nbones but also skin, muscles, and ligaments. It’s made from long strands\n of protein that intertwine to form a tough triple helix.“Collagen\n is the scaffold that holds us together,” Raines says. “What makes the \ncollagen protein so stable, and such a good choice for this scaffold, is\n that unlike most proteins, it’s fibrous.”In the past decade, \npaleobiologists have found evidence of collagen preserved in dinosaur \nfossils, including an 80-million-year-old Tyrannosaurus rex fossil, and a sauropodomorph fossil that is nearly 200 million years old.Over\n the past 25 years, Raines’ lab has been studying collagen and how its \nstructure enables its function. In the new study, they revealed why the \npeptide bonds that hold collagen together are so resistant to being \nbroken down by water.Peptide bonds are formed between a carbon \natom from one amino acid and a nitrogen atom of the adjacent amino acid.\n The carbon atom also forms a double bond with an oxygen atom, forming a\n molecular structure called a carbonyl group. This carbonyl oxygen has a\n pair of electrons that don’t form bonds with any other atoms. Those \nelectrons, the researchers found, can be shared with the carbonyl group \nof a neighboring peptide bond.Because this pair of electrons is \nbeing inserted into those peptide bonds, water molecules can’t also get \ninto the structure to disrupt the bond.To demonstrate this, \nRaines and his colleagues created two interconverting mimics of collagen\n — the one that usually forms a triple helix, which is known as trans, \nand another in which the angles of the peptide bonds are rotated into a \ndifferent form, known as cis. They found that the trans form of collagen\n did not allow water to attack and hydrolyze the bond. In the cis form, \nwater got in and the bonds were broken.“A peptide bond is either \ncis or trans, and we can change the cis to trans ratio. By doing that, \nwe can mimic the natural state of collagen or create an unprotected \npeptide bond. And we saw that when it was unprotected, it was not long \nfor the world,” Raines says.“This work builds on a long-term \neffort in the Raines Group to classify the role of a long-overlooked \nfundamental interaction in protein structure,” says Paramjit Arora, a \nprofessor of chemistry at New York University, who was not involved in \nthe research. “The paper directly addresses the remarkable finding of \nintact collagen in the ribs of a 195-million-old dinosaur fossil, and \nshows that overlap of filled and empty orbitals controls the \nconformational and hydrolytic stability of collagen.”“No weak link”This\n sharing of electrons has also been seen in protein structures known as \nalpha helices, which are found in many proteins. These helices may also \nbe protected from water, but the helices are always connected by protein\n sequences that are more exposed, which are still susceptible to \nhydrolysis.“Collagen is all triple helices, from one end to the \nother,” Raines says. “There’s no weak link, and that’s why I think it \nhas survived.”Previously, some scientists have suggested other \nexplanations for why collagen might be preserved for millions of years, \nincluding the possibility that the bones were so dehydrated that no \nwater could reach the peptide bonds.“I can’t discount the \ncontributions from other factors, but 200 million years is a long time, \nand I think you need something at the molecular level, at the atomic \nlevel in order to explain it,” Raines says.The research was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation."},
    {text: "output: The Longevity of Collagen in Dinosaur Fossils: A Molecular Perspective\nIntroduction\nThe discovery of collagen in \ndinosaur fossils dated at around 195 million years old has puzzled \nscientists, given that the typical half-life of peptide bonds in \nproteins is approximately 500 years. Recent research from MIT offers \ninsights into the remarkable longevity of collagen, attributing its \nresilience to specific atomic-level interactions that defend it against \nhydrolysis, the breakdown caused by water molecules. This comprehensive \nanalysis synthesizes the various perspectives and interpretations of \nthis phenomenon.\nCollagen Structure and Stability\nComposition and Function\nFibrous Protein:\n Collagen is a fibrous protein found abundantly in animals, forming a \nsignificant component of bones, skin, muscles, and ligaments.Triple Helix Formation: It consists of long strands of protein that intertwine into a robust triple helix, providing structural support and stability.\nPeptide Bonds and Water Resistance\nPeptide Bond Formation: Peptide bonds are created between a carbon atom from one amino acid and a nitrogen atom from the adjacent amino acid.Carbonyl Group Role:\n The carbon atom also forms a double bond with an oxygen atom, creating a\n carbonyl group, which has electrons that do not bind with other atoms. \nThese electrons can interact with the carbonyl group of a neighboring \npeptide bond, preventing water molecules from accessing and breaking the\n bond.\nExperimental Evidence\nTrans vs. Cis Forms:\n The research involved creating two collagen mimics: the trans form \n(natural triple helix) and the cis form (altered peptide bond angles). \nThe findings revealed that the trans form resisted hydrolysis, while the\n cis form did not.Protective Electron Sharing:\n The sharing of electrons in the trans form blocks water from degrading \nthe peptide bonds, explaining the long-term stability of collagen in \nancient fossils.\nPrevious Theories and New Insights\nTraditional Explanations\nDehydrated Bones: Earlier theories suggested that the dehydration of bones might protect the collagen by preventing water access.\nMolecular-Level Explanation\nElectron Sharing at Atomic Level:\n The new MIT research provides a molecular-level explanation, suggesting\n that electron sharing within the collagen structure is crucial for its \nexceptional longevity.\nBroader Implications and Future Research\nAlpha Helices in Proteins\nEvidence in Other Structures:\n Similar electron sharing has been observed in alpha helices of various \nproteins, indicating potential protection from water.

    {text: "input: Charging stations for electric vehicles are essential for\n cleaning up the transportation sector. A new study by MIT researchers \nsuggests they’re good for business, too.The study found that, in \nCalifornia, opening a charging station boosted annual spending at each \nnearby business by an average of about $1,500 in 2019 and about $400 \nbetween January 2021 and June 2023. The spending bump amounts to \nthousands of extra dollars annually for nearby businesses, with the \nincrease particularly pronounced for businesses in underresourced areas.The\n study’s authors hope the research paints a more holistic picture of the\n benefits of EV charging stations, beyond environmental factors.“These\n increases are equal to a significant chunk of the cost of installing an\n EV charger, and I hope this study sheds light on these economic \nbenefits,” says lead author Yunhan Zheng MCP ’21, SM ’21, PhD ’24, a \npostdoc at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology \n(SMART). “The findings could also diversify the income stream for \ncharger providers and site hosts, and lead to more informed business \nmodels for EV charging stations.”Zheng’s co-authors on the paper, which was published today in Nature Communications,\n are David Keith, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of \nManagement; Jinhua Zhao, an MIT professor of cities and transportation; \nand alumni Shenhao Wang MCP ’17, SM ’17, PhD ’20 and Mi Diao MCP ’06, \nPhD ’10.Understanding the EV effectIncreasing\n the number of electric vehicle charging stations is seen as a key \nprerequisite for the transition to a cleaner, electrified transportation\n sector. As such, the 2021 U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \ncommitted $7.5 billion to build a national network of public electric \nvehicle chargers across the U.S.But a large amount of private investment will also be needed to make charging stations ubiquitous.“The\n U.S. is investing a lot in EV chargers and really encouraging EV \nadoption, but many EV charging providers can’t make enough money at this\n stage, and getting to profitability is a major challenge,” Zheng says.EV\n advocates have long argued that the presence of charging stations \nbrings economic benefits to surrounding communities, but Zheng says \nprevious studies on their impact relied on surveys or were small-scale. \nHer team of collaborators wanted to make advocates’ claims more \nempirical.For their study, the researchers collected data from \nover 4,000 charging stations in California and 140,000 businesses, \nrelying on anonymized credit and debit card transactions to measure \nchanges in consumer spending. The researchers used data from 2019 \nthrough June of 2023, skipping the year 2020 to minimize the impact of \nthe pandemic.To judge whether charging stations caused customer \nspending increases, the researchers compared data from businesses within\n 500 meters of new charging stations before and after their \ninstallation. They also analyzed transactions from similar businesses in\n the same time frame that weren’t near charging stations.Supercharging nearby businessesThe\n researchers found that installing a charging station boosted annual \nspending at nearby establishments by an average of 1.4 percent in 2019 \nand 0.8 percent from January 2021 to June 2023.While that might \nsound like a small amount per business, it amounts to thousands of \ndollars in overall consumer spending increases. Specifically, those \npercentages translate to almost $23,000 in cumulative spending increases\n in 2019 and about $3,400 per year from 2021 through June 2023.Zheng\n says the decline in spending increases over the two time periods might \nbe due to a saturation of EV chargers, leading to lower utilization, as \nwell as an overall decrease in spending per business after the Covid-19 \npandemic and a reduced number of businesses served by each EV charging \nstation in the second period. Despite this decline, the annual impact of\n a charging station on all its surrounding businesses would still cover \napproximately 11.2 percent of the average infrastructure and \ninstallation cost of a standard charging station.Through both \ntime frames, the spending increases were highest for businesses within \nabout a football field’s distance from the new stations. They were also \nsignificant for businesses in disadvantaged and low-income areas, as \ndesignated by California and the Justice40 Initiative.“The \npositive impacts of EV charging stations on businesses are not \nconstrained solely to some high-income neighborhoods,” Wang says. “It \nhighlights the importance for policymakers to develop EV charging \nstations in marginalized areas, because they not only foster a cleaner \nenvironment, but also serve as a catalyst for enhancing economic \nvitality.”Zheng believes the findings hold a lesson for charging \nstation developers seeking to improve the profitability of their \nprojects.“The joint gas station and convenience store business \nmodel could also be adopted to EV charging stations,” Zheng says. \n“Traditionally, many gas stations are affiliated with retail store \nchains, which enables owners to both sell fuel and attract customers to \ndiversify their revenue stream. EV charging providers could consider a \nsimilar approach to internalize the positive impact of EV charging \nstations.”Zheng also says the findings could support the creation\n of new funding models for charging stations, such as multiple \nbusinesses sharing the costs of construction so they can all benefit \nfrom the added spending.Those changes could accelerate the \ncreation of charging networks, but Zheng cautions that further research \nis needed to understand how much the study’s findings can be \nextrapolated to other areas. She encourages other researchers to study \nthe economic effects of charging stations and hopes future research \nincludes states beyond California and even other countries.“A \nhuge number of studies have focused on retail sales effects from \ntraditional transportation infrastructure, such as rail and subway \nstations, bus stops, and street configurations,” Zhao says. “This \nresearch provides evidence for an important, emerging piece of \ntransportation infrastructure and shows a consistently positive effect \non local businesses, paving the way for future research in this area.”The\n research was supported, in part, by the Singapore-MIT Alliance for \nResearch and Technology (SMART) and the Singapore National Research \nFoundation.

This piece delves into the comprehensive \nimpacts of EV charging stations, analyzing data, economic implications, \nand policy recommendations.\nKey Benefits of EV Charging Stations\nEconomic Boost for Local Businesses\nThe installation of EV charging stations has been shown to:\nIncrease Annual Spending:\n In California, businesses within 500 meters of a new charging station \nsaw an increase in annual spending by approximately 1.4% in 2019 and \n0.8% from January 2021 to June 2023. These percentages translate to \nnearly $23,000 in 2019 and $3,400 annually from 2021 onwards.Support Underresourced Areas:\n The spending boost was notably higher in disadvantaged and low-income \nareas, underscoring the potential for EV infrastructure to foster \neconomic development in marginalized communities.\nBenefits Beyond Environmental Impact\nWhile EV charging stations \nsignificantly cut emissions, their economic implications are equally \nimportant.

    {text: "input: Low-calorie diets and intermittent fasting have been \nshown to have numerous health benefits: They can delay the onset of some\n age-related diseases and lengthen lifespan, not only in humans but many\n other organisms.Many complex mechanisms underlie this \nphenomenon. Previous work from MIT has shown that one way fasting exerts\n its beneficial effects is by boosting the regenerative abilities of \nintestinal stem cells, which helps the intestine recover from injuries \nor inflammation.In a study of mice, MIT researchers have now \nidentified the pathway that enables this enhanced regeneration, which is\n activated once the mice begin “refeeding” after the fast. They also \nfound a downside to this regeneration: When cancerous mutations occurred\n during the regenerative period, the mice were more likely to develop \nearly-stage intestinal tumors.“Having more stem cell activity is \ngood for regeneration, but too much of a good thing over time can have \nless favorable consequences,” says Omer Yilmaz, an MIT associate \nprofessor of biology, a member of MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative \nCancer Research, and the senior author of the new study.Yilmaz adds that further studies are needed before forming any conclusion as to whether fasting has a similar effect in humans.“We\n still have a lot to learn, but it is interesting that being in either \nthe state of fasting or refeeding when exposure to mutagen occurs can \nhave a profound impact on the likelihood of developing a cancer in these\n well-defined mouse models,” he says.MIT postdocs Shinya Imada and Saleh Khawaled are the lead authors of the paper, which appears today in Nature.Driving regenerationFor several years, Yilmaz’s lab has been investigating how fasting and low-calorie diets affect intestinal health. In a 2018 study,\n his team reported that during a fast, intestinal stem cells begin to \nuse lipids as an energy source, instead of carbohydrates. They also \nshowed that fasting led to a significant boost in stem cells’ \nregenerative ability.However, unanswered questions remained: How \ndoes fasting trigger this boost in regenerative ability, and when does \nthe regeneration begin?“Since that paper, we’ve really been \nfocused on understanding what is it about fasting that drives \nregeneration,” Yilmaz says. “Is it fasting itself that’s driving \nregeneration, or eating after the fast?”In their new study, the \nresearchers found that stem cell regeneration is suppressed during \nfasting but then surges during the refeeding period. The researchers \nfollowed three groups of mice — one that fasted for 24 hours, another \none that fasted for 24 hours and then was allowed to eat whatever they \nwanted during a 24-hour refeeding period, and a control group that ate \nwhatever they wanted throughout the experiment.The researchers \nanalyzed intestinal stem cells’ ability to proliferate at different time\n points and found that the stem cells showed the highest levels of \nproliferation at the end of the 24-hour refeeding period. These cells \nwere also more proliferative than intestinal stem cells from mice that \nhad not fasted at all.“We think that fasting and refeeding \nrepresent two distinct states,” Imada says. “In the fasted state, the \nability of cells to use lipids and fatty acids as an energy source \nenables them to survive when nutrients are low. And then it’s the \npostfast refeeding state that really drives the regeneration. When \nnutrients become available, these stem cells and progenitor cells \nactivate programs that enable them to build cellular mass and repopulate\n the intestinal lining.”Further studies revealed that these cells\n activate a cellular signaling pathway known as mTOR, which is involved \nin cell growth and metabolism. One of mTOR’s roles is to regulate the \ntranslation of messenger RNA into protein, so when it’s activated, cells\n produce more protein. This protein synthesis is essential for stem \ncells to proliferate.The researchers showed that mTOR activation \nin these stem cells also led to production of large quantities of \npolyamines — small molecules that help cells to grow and divide.“In\n the refed state, you’ve got more proliferation, and you need to build \ncellular mass. That requires more protein, to build new cells, and those\n stem cells go on to build more differentiated cells or specialized \nintestinal cell types that line the intestine,” Khawaled says.Too much of a good thingThe\n researchers also found that when stem cells are in this highly \nregenerative state, they are more prone to become cancerous. Intestinal \nstem cells are among the most actively dividing cells in the body, as \nthey help the lining of the intestine completely turn over every five to\n 10 days. Because they divide so frequently, these stem cells are the \nmost common source of precancerous cells in the intestine.In this\n study, the researchers discovered that if they turned on a \ncancer-causing gene in the mice during the refeeding stage, they were \nmuch more likely to develop precancerous polyps than if the gene was \nturned on during the fasting state. Cancer-linked mutations that \noccurred during the refeeding state were also much more likely to \nproduce polyps than mutations that occurred in mice that did not undergo\n the cycle of fasting and refeeding.“I want to emphasize that \nthis was all done in mice, using very well-defined cancer mutations. In \nhumans it’s going to be a much more complex state,” Yilmaz says. “But it\n does lead us to the following notion: Fasting is very healthy, but if \nyou’re unlucky and you’re refeeding after a fasting, and you get exposed\n to a mutagen, like a charred steak or something, you might actually be \nincreasing your chances of developing a lesion that can go on to give \nrise to cancer.”Yilmaz also noted that the regenerative benefits \nof fasting could be significant for people who undergo radiation \ntreatment, which can damage the intestinal lining, or other types of \nintestinal injury. His lab is now studying whether polyamine supplements\n could help to stimulate this kind of regeneration, without the need to \nfast.“This fascinating study provides insights into the complex \ninterplay between food consumption, stem cell biology, and cancer risk,”\n says Ophir Klein, a professor of medicine at the University of \nCalifornia at San Francisco and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, who was not\n involved in the study. “Their work lays a foundation for testing \npolyamines as compounds that may augment intestinal repair after \ninjuries, and it suggests that careful consideration is needed when \nplanning diet-based strategies for regeneration to avoid increasing \ncancer risk.”The research was funded, in part, by Pew-Stewart \nScholars Program for Cancer Research award, the MIT Stem Cell \nInitiative, the Koch Institute Frontier Research Program via the Kathy \nand Curt Marble Cancer Research Fund, and the Bridge Project, a \npartnership between the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research \nat MIT and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center."},
    {text: "output: The Impact of Fasting on Intestinal Stem Cell Regeneration and Cancer Risk\nIntroduction\nFasting and low-calorie diets \nhave been widely acknowledged for their health benefits, including \ndelaying age-related diseases and extending lifespan. One of the crucial\n ways fasting achieves this is by enhancing the regenerative abilities \nof intestinal stem cells. While this benefit is significant, recent \nstudies have highlighted potential risks associated with this increased \nregeneration, particularly regarding cancer development.\nThe Regenerative Effects of Fasting\nMechanisms of Regeneration\nEnergy Source Utilization:\n During fasting, intestinal stem cells switch from using carbohydrates \nto lipids and fatty acids as their primary energy source. This metabolic\n flexibility enables them to survive periods of nutrient scarcity.Enhanced Proliferation Post-Fasting:\n Research has shown that stem cell proliferation is significantly \nheightened during the refeeding period following fasting. This suggests \nthat the regenerative phase is activated upon nutrient availability.\nCellular Pathways Involved\nmTOR Pathway Activation:\n The mTOR signaling pathway is crucial for cell growth and metabolism. \nIts activation during the refeeding period leads to increased protein \nsynthesis, necessary for building new cells.Polyamine Production: mTOR activation also results in the production of polyamines, small molecules that are vital for cell growth and division.\nRisks of Enhanced Stem Cell Regeneration\nPotential for Cancer Development\nWhile a surge in stem cell proliferation aids regeneration, it also carries risk:\nIncreased Cancer Susceptibility:\n Intestinal stem cells, due to their frequent division, are already \ncommon sources of precancerous cells. The heightened regenerative state \nthat follows fasting can increase the risk of these precancerous cells \ndeveloping into cancerous tumors.Impact of Refeeding:\n Studies have demonstrated that cancer-causing mutations during the \nrefeeding stage are more likely to lead to tumor development compared to\n those occurring during fasting. This implies a heightened cancer risk \nassociated with the post-fasting regenerative period.\nExperimental Evidence\nMouse Model Experiments:\n Research involving mice with induced cancer mutations revealed that \nthose mutations were more prone to develop into tumors during the \nrefeeding phase than in the fasting phase. This highlights the complex \nrelationship between fasting, regeneration, and cancer risk .\nImplications for Human Health\nConsiderations for Fasting Practices\nPotential Benefits:\n Fasting may offer significant regenerative benefits, especially for \nthose recovering from treatments such as radiation therapy that damage \nthe intestinal lining.Need for Cautious Application:\n However, the increased cancer risk associated with the refeeding period\n necessitates cautious application of fasting regimens in clinical and \nhealth settings.\nFuture Research Directions\nHuman Studies:\n Further research is required to understand how these findings translate\n to humans, considering the complexity of human metabolism and cancer \nbiology.Polyamine Supplements:\n Exploring the potential of polyamine supplements to harness \nregenerative benefits without the need for fasting is an ongoing \nresearch area.\nConclusion\nFasting and low-calorie diets \nenhance the regenerative capacity of intestinal stem cells, offering \nnumerous health benefits. However, the increased proliferation during \nthe refeeding period poses a risk for cancer development. This \ndual-edged effect underscores the need for a balanced approach to \nfasting practices, with further research essential for safely leveraging\n these benefits in human health.\nReferences\nMIT research on fasting and intestinal stem cells ."},
    {text: "input: Legal documents are notoriously difficult to understand, \neven for lawyers. This raises the question: Why are these documents \nwritten in a style that makes them so impenetrable?MIT cognitive \nscientists believe they have uncovered the answer to that question. Just\n as “magic spells” use special rhymes and archaic terms to signal their \npower, the convoluted language of legalese acts to convey a sense of \nauthority, they conclude.In a study appearing this week in the journal of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the researchers found that even non-lawyers use this type of language when asked to write laws.“People\n seem to understand that there’s an implicit rule that this is how laws \nshould sound, and they write them that way,” says Edward Gibson, an MIT \nprofessor of brain and cognitive sciences and the senior author of the \nstudy.Eric Martinez PhD ’24 is the lead author of the study. \nFrancis Mollica, a lecturer at the University of Melbourne, is also an \nauthor of the paper.Casting a legal spellGibson’s\n research group has been studying the unique characteristics of legalese\n since 2020, when Martinez came to MIT after earning a law degree from \nHarvard Law School. In a 2022 study,\n Gibson, Martinez, and Mollica analyzed legal contracts totaling about \n3.5 million words, comparing them with other types of writing, including\n movie scripts, newspaper articles, and academic papers.That \nanalysis revealed that legal documents frequently have long definitions \ninserted in the middle of sentences — a feature known as \n“center-embedding.” Linguists have previously found that this kind of \nstructure can make text much more difficult to understand.“Legalese\n somehow has developed this tendency to put structures inside other \nstructures, in a way which is not typical of human languages,” Gibson \nsays.In a follow-up study\n published in 2023, the researchers found that legalese also makes \ndocuments more difficult for lawyers to understand. Lawyers tended to \nprefer plain English versions of documents, and they rated those \nversions to be just as enforceable as traditional legal documents.“Lawyers\n also find legalese to be unwieldy and complicated,” Gibson says. \n“Lawyers don’t like it, laypeople don’t like it, so the point of this \ncurrent paper was to try and figure out why they write documents this \nway.”The researchers had a couple of hypotheses for why legalese \nis so prevalent. One was the “copy and edit hypothesis,” which suggests \nthat legal documents begin with a simple premise, and then additional \ninformation and definitions are inserted into already existing \nsentences, creating complex center-embedded clauses.“We thought \nit was plausible that what happens is you start with an initial draft \nthat’s simple, and then later you think of all these other conditions \nthat you want to include. And the idea is that once you’ve started, it’s\n much easier to center-embed that into the existing provision,” says \nMartinez, who is now a fellow and instructor at the University of \nChicago Law School.However, the findings ended up pointing toward\n a different hypothesis, the so-called “magic spell hypothesis.” Just as\n magic spells are written with a distinctive style that sets them apart \nfrom everyday language, the convoluted style of legal language appears \nto signal a special kind of authority, the researchers say.“In \nEnglish culture, if you want to write something that’s a magic spell, \npeople know that the way to do that is you put a lot of old-fashioned \nrhymes in there. We think maybe center-embedding is signaling legalese \nin the same way,” Gibson says.In this study, the researchers \nasked about 200 non-lawyers (native speakers of English living in the \nUnited States, who were recruited through a crowdsourcing site called \nProlific), to write two types of texts. In the first task, people were \ntold to write laws prohibiting crimes such as drunk driving, burglary, \narson, and drug trafficking. In the second task, they were asked to \nwrite stories about those crimes.To test the copy and edit \nhypothesis, half of the participants were asked to add additional \ninformation after they wrote their initial law or story. The researchers\n found that all of the subjects wrote laws with center-embedded clauses,\n regardless of whether they wrote the law all at once or were told to \nwrite a draft and then add to it later. And, when they wrote stories \nrelated to those laws, they wrote in much plainer English, regardless of\n whether they had to add information later.“When writing laws, \nthey did a lot of center-embedding regardless of whether or not they had\n to edit it or write it from scratch. And in that narrative text, they \ndid not use center-embedding in either case,” Martinez says.In \nanother set of experiments, about 80 participants were asked to write \nlaws, as well as descriptions that would explain those laws to visitors \nfrom another country. In these experiments, participants again used \ncenter-embedding for their laws, but not for the descriptions of those \nlaws.The origins of legaleseGibson’s lab \nis now investigating the origins of center-embedding in legal documents.\n Early American laws were based on British law, so the researchers plan \nto analyze British laws to see if they feature the same kind of \ngrammatical construction. And going back much farther, they plan to \nanalyze whether center-embedding is found in the Hammurabi Code, the \nearliest known set of laws, which dates to around 1750 BC.“There \nmay be just a stylistic way of writing from back then, and if it was \nseen as successful, people would use that style in other languages,” \nGibson says. “I would guess that it’s an accidental property of how the \nlaws were written the first time, but we don’t know that yet.”The\n researchers hope that their work, which has identified specific aspects\n of legal language that make it more difficult to understand, will \nmotivate lawmakers to try to make laws more comprehensible. Efforts to \nwrite legal documents in plainer language date to at least the 1970s, \nwhen President Richard Nixon declared that federal regulations should be\n written in “layman’s terms.” However, legal language has changed very \nlittle since that time.“We have learned only very recently what \nit is that makes legal language so complicated, and therefore I am \noptimistic about being able to change it,” Gibson says."},
    {text: "output: The Complexity of Legal Language\nIntroduction\nLegal language, often referred \nto as \"legalese,\" is notoriously difficult to understand. This \ncomplexity poses significant challenges not only for laypeople but also \nfor legal professionals. Recent research by MIT cognitive scientists \nsheds light on the reasons behind this convoluted style of writing, \nsuggesting that legalese serves a purpose akin to a \"magic spell,\" \nconferring authority and legitimacy to the text.\nThe Nature of Legalese\nCharacteristics of Legalese\nLegalese often includes:\nCenter-embedding: Inserting long definitions or information in the middle of sentences.Complex Sentence Structures: Using nested clauses that disrupt the natural flow of language.Archaic Terminology: Employing outdated words that are no longer in common use.\nThese characteristics collectively make legal documents more difficult to read and comprehend.\nImpact on Comprehension\nResearch has shown that legalese:\nMakes documents harder to understand, even for lawyers.Results in preferences for plain English versions of the same text, which are perceived to be equally enforceable.\nHypotheses for the Prevalence of Legalese\nCopy and Edit Hypothesis\nOne hypothesis suggested that \nlegal documents begin with simple drafts. Over time, additional clauses,\n definitions, and conditions are inserted, creating complex, \ncenter-embedded structures. This practice could be driven by the need to\n cover all potential legal bases, making the language progressively more\n complicated with each revision.\nMagic Spell Hypothesis\nAn alternative hypothesis, \nlabeled the \"magic spell hypothesis,\" posits that the convoluted style \nserves to signal a special kind of authority. Just as magic spells \nemploy distinct, archaic language to signify their power, legalese might\n be deliberately complex to underscore the importance and official \nstatus of legal texts.\nExperimental Support\nStudy Design\nResearchers conducted a series of studies involving about 200 non-lawyers who were asked to perform two tasks:\nWrite laws prohibiting specific crimes such as drunk driving and burglary.Narrate stories about those crimes.\nFindings\nParticipants consistently used center-embedded clauses when writing \nlaws, regardless of whether they edited the text after an initial draft \nor not.For the narrative tasks, they wrote in plain English without center embedding, regardless of subsequent edits.Additional experiments with about 80 participants had similar \noutcomes: center-embedding was used for writing laws but not for \nexplaining those laws to outsiders.\nOrigins and Future Research\nHistorical Context\nLegalese's tendency for complex \nstructures possibly traces back to British law and even earlier legal \ncodes like the Hammurabi Code. Researchers aim to investigate if similar\n grammatical constructions were present in these ancient laws, \nsuggesting a stylistic legacy that persists in modern legal texts.\nImplications for Legal Reform\nThe insights gathered from this \nresearch underline the potential for reforming legal language. \nSimplifying legal documents could make laws more accessible to the \ngeneral public. Efforts to write in plain language have been ongoing \nsince the 1970s, but there remains significant room for improvement.\nConclusion\nUnderstanding why legal language\n is so complex can pave the way for creating more comprehensible legal \ntexts. Both the \"copy and edit\" and \"magic spell\" hypotheses offer \nvaluable insights into the traditional and psychological reasons behind \nlegalese. Moving forward, this research may inspire efforts to demystify\n legal texts, making them more accessible without compromising their \nenforceability or authority.\n\nBy synthesizing recent findings \non the complexity of legal language, this article provides an in-depth \nanalysis suitable for academic and professional study, ensuring the \nretention of critical information and highlighting key concepts."},
    {text: "input: 2023, more than 100,000 Americans died from opioid \noverdoses. The most effective way to save someone who has overdosed is \nto administer a drug called naloxone, but a first responder or bystander\n can’t always reach the person who has overdosed in time.Researchers\n at MIT and Brigham and Women’s Hospital have developed a new device \nthat they hope will help to eliminate those delays and potentially save \nthe lives of people who overdose. The device, about the size of a stick \nof gum, can be implanted under the skin, where it monitors heart rate, \nbreathing rate, and other vital signs.

With further development, the researchers envision\n that this approach could provide a new option for helping to prevent \noverdose deaths in high-risk populations, such as people who have \nalready survived an overdose.“This could really address a \nsignificant unmet need in the population that suffers from substance \nabuse and opiate dependency to help mitigate overdoses, with the initial\n focus on the high-risk population,” says Giovanni Traverso, an \nassociate professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, a \ngastroenterologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the senior \nauthor of the study.The paper’s lead authors are Hen-Wei Huang, a\n former MIT visiting scientist and currently an assistant professor of \nelectrical and electronic engineering at Nanyang Technological \nUniversity in Singapore; Peter Chai, an associate professor of emergency\n medicine physician at Brigham and Women’s Hospital; SeungHo Lee, a \nresearch scientist at MIT’s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer \nResearch; Tom Kerssemakers and Ali Imani, former master’s students at \nBrigham and Women’s Hospital; and Jack Chen, a doctoral student in \nmechanical engineering at MIT.An implantable deviceNaloxone\n is an opioid antagonist, meaning that it can bind to opioid receptors \nand block the effects of other opioids, including heroin and fentanyl. \nThe drug, which is given by injection or as a nasal spray, can restore \nnormal breathing within just a few minutes of being administered.However,\n many people are alone when they overdose, and may not receive \nassistance in time to save their lives. Additionally, with a new wave of\n synthetic, more potent opioids sweeping the U.S., opioid overdoses can \nbe more rapid in onset and unpredictable. To try to overcome that, some \nresearchers are developing wearable devices that could detect an \noverdose and administer naloxone, but none of those have yet proven \nsuccessful. The MIT/BWH team set out to design an implantable device \nthat would be less bulky, provide direct injection of naloxone into the \nsubcutaneous tissue, and eliminate the need for the patient to remember \nto wear it.The device that the researchers came up with includes \nsensors that can detect heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, and \noxygen saturation. In an animal study, the researchers used the sensors \nto measure all of these signals and determine exactly how they change \nduring an overdose of fentanyl. This resulted in a unique algorithm that\n increases the sensitivity of the device to accurately detect opioid \noverdose and distinguish it from other conditions where breathing is \ndecreased, such as sleep apnea.This study showed that fentanyl \nfirst leads to a drop in heart rate, followed quickly by a slowdown of \nbreathing. By measuring how these signals changed, the researchers were \nable to calculate the point at which naloxone administration should be \ntriggered.“The most challenging aspect of developing an \nengineering solution to prevent overdose mortality is simultaneously \naddressing patient adherence and willingness to adopt new technology, \ncombating stigma, minimizing false positive detections, and ensuring the\n rapid delivery of antidotes,” says Huang. “Our proposed solution \ntackles these unmet needs by developing a miniaturized robotic implant \nequipped with multisensing modalities, continuous monitoring \ncapabilities, on-board decision making, and an innovative micropumping \nmechanism.”The device also includes a small reservoir that can \ncarry up to 10 milligrams of naloxone. When an overdose is detected, it \ntriggers a pump that ejects the naloxone, which is released within about\n 10 seconds.In their animal studies, the researchers found that \nthis drug administration could reverse the effects of an overdose 96 \npercent of the time.“We created a closed-loop system that can \nsense the onset of the opiate overdose and then release the antidote, \nand then you see that recovery,” Traverso says.Preventing overdosesThe\n researchers envision that this technology could be used to help people \nwho are at the highest risk of overdose, beginning with people who have \nhad a previous overdose. They now plan to investigate how to make the \ndevice as user-friendly as possible, studying factors such as the \noptimal location for implantation.“A key pillar of addressing the\n opioid epidemic is providing naloxone to individuals at key moments of \nrisk. Our vision for this device is for it to integrate into the cascade\n of harm-reduction strategies to efficiently and safely deliver \nnaloxone, preventing death from opioid overdose and providing the \nopportunity to support individuals with opioid use disorder,” says Chai.The\n researchers hope to be able to test the device in humans within the \nnext three to five years. They are now working on miniaturizing the \ndevice further and optimizing the on-board battery, which currently can \nprovide power for about two weeks.The research was funded by Novo\n Nordisk, the McGraw Family Foundation at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, \nand the MIT Department of Mechanical Engineering."},
    {text: "output: Implantable Device for Opioid Overdose Prevention\nIntroduction\nThe opioid crisis continues to \nbe a significant public health challenge, with over 100,000 Americans \ndying from opioid overdoses annually. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is\n currently the most effective treatment for reversing overdoses but \nrelies on timely administration by first responders or bystanders. \nResearchers at MIT and Brigham and Women's Hospital have developed a new\n implantable device that could provide a more reliable solution.\nDevelopment of the Device\nObjectives\nThe primary goals in developing this device were to:\nProvide a less bulky, more discreet alternative to existing wearable devices.Directly administer naloxone subcutaneously without requiring patient intervention.Achieve high sensitivity in overdose detection while minimizing false positives.\nDesign and Components\nThe device designed by the MIT/BWH team includes:\nSensors: Capable of measuring heart rate, breathing rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.Algorithm:\n Developed to accurately detect opioid overdoses by monitoring \nphysiological changes such as a drop in heart rate followed by a \nslowdown in breathing.Naloxone Reservoir: Holds up to 10 milligrams of naloxone.Micropump Mechanism: Ejects naloxone rapidly once an overdose is detected.\nFunctionality and Testing\nIn animal studies, the device \ndemonstrated an ability to reverse the effects of an overdose 96% of the\n time, using its sensors to trigger naloxone administration within 10 \nseconds of detecting critical changes in physiological signals.\nAdvantages and Challenges\nAdvantages\nImmediate Response:\n The device provides an almost immediate response to detected overdoses,\n administering antidotes much faster than would be possible for an \nexternal responder.Minimal Intervention:\n Once implanted, it requires no action from the patient, which is \ncrucial for individuals who might be alone during an overdose.Sensitivity and Specificity:\n The developed algorithm enhances the device's ability to distinguish \nbetween an overdose and other conditions with decreased breathing, such \nas sleep apnea.\nChallenges\nPatient Adherence: Ensuring that individuals are willing to adopt and maintain such an implantable device in the long term.Stigma: Addressing the stigma associated with substance abuse and technological interventions.Minimizing False Positives: Reducing the likelihood of unnecessary naloxone administration triggered by false alarms.\nFuture Directions\nHuman Trials\nThe researchers plan to test the\n device in human subjects within the next three to five years, focusing \non optimizing user-friendliness, including the best location for \nimplantation.

    {text: "input: In late 2023, the first drug with\n potential to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease was approved \nby the U.S. Federal Drug Administration. Alzheimer's is one of many \ndebilitating neurological disorders that together affect one-eighth of \nthe world's population, and while the new drug is a step in the right \ndirection, there is still a long journey ahead to fully understanding \nit, and other such diseases.\"Reconstructing the intricacies of \nhow the human brain functions on a cellular level is one of the biggest \nchallenges in neuroscience,\" says Lars Gjesteby, a technical staff \nmember and algorithm developer from the MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Human Health and Performance Systems Group.\n \"High-resolution, networked brain atlases can help improve our \nunderstanding of disorders by pinpointing differences between healthy \nand diseased brains. However, progress has been hindered by insufficient\n tools to visualize and process very large brain imaging datasets.\"A\n networked brain atlas is in essence a detailed map of the brain that \ncan help link structural information with neural function. To build such\n atlases, brain imaging data need to be processed and annotated. For \nexample, each axon, or thin fiber connecting neurons, needs to be \ntraced, measured, and labeled with information. Current methods of \nprocessing brain imaging data, such as desktop-based software or \nmanual-oriented tools, are not yet designed to handle human brain-scale \ndatasets. As such, researchers often spend a lot of time slogging \nthrough an ocean of raw data.Gjesteby is leading a project to \nbuild the Neuron Tracing and Active Learning Environment (NeuroTrALE), a\n software pipeline that brings machine learning, supercomputing, as well\n as ease of use and access to this brain mapping challenge. NeuroTrALE \nautomates much of the data processing and displays the output in an \ninteractive interface that allows researchers to edit and manipulate the\n data to mark, filter, and search for specific patterns.Untangling a ball of yarnOne\n of NeuroTrALE's defining features is the machine-learning technique it \nemploys, called active learning. NeuroTrALE's algorithms are trained to \nautomatically label incoming data based on existing brain imaging data, \nbut unfamiliar data can present potential for errors. Active learning \nallows users to manually correct errors, teaching the algorithm to \nimprove the next time it encounters similar data. This mix of automation\n and manual labeling ensures accurate data processing with a much \nsmaller burden on the user.\"Imagine taking an X-ray of a ball of \nyarn. You'd see all these crisscrossed, overlapping lines,\" says Michael\n Snyder, from the laboratory's Homeland Decision Support Systems Group. \n\"When two lines cross, does it mean one of the pieces of yarn is making a\n 90-degree bend, or is one going straight up and the other is going \nstraight over? With NeuroTrALE's active learning, users can trace these \nstrands of yarn one or two times and train the algorithm to follow them \ncorrectly moving forward. Without NeuroTrALE, the user would have to \ntrace the ball of yarn, or in this case the axons of the human brain, \nevery single time.\" Snyder is a software developer on the NeuroTrALE \nteam along with staff member David Chavez.Because NeuroTrALE \ntakes the bulk of the labeling burden off of the user, it allows \nresearchers to process more data more quickly. Further, the axon tracing\n algorithms harness parallel computing to distribute computations across\n multiple GPUs at once, leading to even faster, scalable processing. \nUsing NeuroTrALE, the team demonstrated a 90 percent decrease in computing time needed to process 32 gigabytes of data over conventional AI methods.The\n team also showed that a substantial increase in the volume of data does\n not translate to an equivalent increase in processing time. For \nexample, in a recent study\n they demonstrated that a 10,000 percent increase in dataset size \nresulted in only a 9 percent and a 22 percent increase in total data \nprocessing time, using two different types of central processing units.\"With\n the estimated 86 billion neurons making 100 trillion connections in the\n human brain, manually labeling all the axons in a single brain would \ntake lifetimes,\" adds Benjamin Roop, one of the project's algorithm \ndevelopers. \"This tool has the potential to automate the creation of \nconnectomes for not just one individual, but many. That opens the door \nfor studying brain disease at the population level.\"The open-source road to discoveryThe NeuroTrALE project was formed as an internally funded collaboration between Lincoln Laboratory and Professor Kwanghun Chung's\n laboratory on MIT campus. The Lincoln Lab team needed to build a way \nfor the Chung Lab researchers to analyze and extract useful information \nfrom their large amount of brain imaging data flowing into the MIT SuperCloud\n — a supercomputer run by Lincoln Laboratory to support MIT research. \nLincoln Lab's expertise in high-performance computing, image processing,\n and artificial intelligence made it exceptionally suited to tackling \nthis challenge.In 2020, the team uploaded NeuroTrALE to the SuperCloud and by 2022 the Chung Lab was producing results. In one study, published in Science,\n they used NeuroTrALE to quantify prefrontal cortex cell density in \nrelation to Alzheimer's disease, where brains affected with the disease \nhad a lower cell density in certain regions than those without. The same\n team also located where in the brain harmful neurofibers tend to get \ntangled in Alzheimer's-affected brain tissue.Work on NeuroTrALE \nhas continued with Lincoln Laboratory funding and funding from the \nNational Institutes of Health (NIH) to build up NeuroTrALE's \ncapabilities. Currently, its user interface tools are being integrated with Google's Neuroglancer\n program — an open-source, web-based viewer application for neuroscience\n data. NeuroTrALE adds the ability for users to visualize and edit their\n annotated data dynamically, and for multiple users to work with the \nsame data at the same time. Users can also create and edit a number of \nshapes such as polygons, points, and lines to facilitate annotation \ntasks, as well as customize color display for each annotation to \ndistinguish neurons in dense regions.\"NeuroTrALE provides a \nplatform-agnostic, end-to-end solution that can be easily and rapidly \ndeployed on standalone, virtual, cloud, and high performance computing \nenvironments via containers.\" says Adam Michaleas, a high performance \ncomputing engineer from the laboratory's Artificial Intelligence Technology Group.\n \"Furthermore, it significantly improves the end user experience by \nproviding capabilities for real-time collaboration within the \nneuroscience community via data visualization and simultaneous content \nreview.\"To align with NIH's mission\n of sharing research products, the team's goal is to make NeuroTrALE a \nfully open-source tool for anyone to use. And this type of tool, says \nGjesteby, is what's needed to reach the end goal of mapping the entirety\n of the human brain for research, and eventually drug development. \"It's\n a grassroots effort by the community where data and algorithms are \nmeant to be shared and accessed by all.\""},

    {text: "input: Charging stations for electric vehicles are essential for\n cleaning up the transportation sector. A new study by MIT researchers \nsuggests they’re good for business, too.The study found that, in \nCalifornia, opening a charging station boosted annual spending at each \nnearby business by an average of about $1,500 in 2019 and about $400 \nbetween January 2021 and June 2023. The spending bump amounts to \nthousands of extra dollars annually for nearby businesses, with the \nincrease particularly pronounced for businesses in underresourced areas.The\n study’s authors hope the research paints a more holistic picture of the\n benefits of EV charging stations, beyond environmental factors.“These\n increases are equal to a significant chunk of the cost of installing an\n EV charger, and I hope this study sheds light on these economic \nbenefits,” says lead author Yunhan Zheng MCP ’21, SM ’21, PhD ’24, a \npostdoc at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology \n(SMART). “The findings could also diversify the income stream for \ncharger providers and site hosts, and lead to more informed business \nmodels for EV charging stations.”Zheng’s co-authors on the paper, which was published today in Nature Communications,\n are David Keith, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of \nManagement; Jinhua Zhao, an MIT professor of cities and transportation; \nand alumni Shenhao Wang MCP ’17, SM ’17, PhD ’20 and Mi Diao MCP ’06, \nPhD ’10.Understanding the EV effectIncreasing\n the number of electric vehicle charging stations is seen as a key \nprerequisite for the transition to a cleaner, electrified transportation\n sector. As such, the 2021 U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act \ncommitted $7.5 billion to build a national network of public electric \nvehicle chargers across the U.S.But a large amount of private investment will also be needed to make charging stations ubiquitous.“The\n U.S. is investing a lot in EV chargers and really encouraging EV \nadoption, but many EV charging providers can’t make enough money at this\n stage, and getting to profitability is a major challenge,” Zheng says.EV\n advocates have long argued that the presence of charging stations \nbrings economic benefits to surrounding communities, but Zheng says \nprevious studies on their impact relied on surveys or were small-scale. \nHer team of collaborators wanted to make advocates’ claims more \nempirical.For their study, the researchers collected data from \nover 4,000 charging stations in California and 140,000 businesses, \nrelying on anonymized credit and debit card transactions to measure \nchanges in consumer spending. The researchers used data from 2019 \nthrough June of 2023, skipping the year 2020 to minimize the impact of \nthe pandemic.To judge whether charging stations caused customer \nspending increases, the researchers compared data from businesses within\n 500 meters of new charging stations before and after their \ninstallation. They also analyzed transactions from similar businesses in\n the same time frame that weren’t near charging stations.Supercharging nearby businessesThe\n researchers found that installing a charging station boosted annual \nspending at nearby establishments by an average of 1.4 percent in 2019 \nand 0.8 percent from January 2021 to June 2023.While that might \nsound like a small amount per business, it amounts to thousands of \ndollars in overall consumer spending increases. Specifically, those \npercentages translate to almost $23,000 in cumulative spending increases\n in 2019 and about $3,400 per year from 2021 through June 2023.Zheng\n says the decline in spending increases over the two time periods might \nbe due to a saturation of EV chargers, leading to lower utilization, as \nwell as an overall decrease in spending per business after the Covid-19 \npandemic and a reduced number of businesses served by each EV charging \nstation in the second period. Despite this decline, the annual impact of\n a charging station on all its surrounding businesses would still cover \napproximately 11.2 percent of the average infrastructure and \ninstallation cost of a standard charging station.Through both \ntime frames, the spending increases were highest for businesses within \nabout a football field’s distance from the new stations. They were also \nsignificant for businesses in disadvantaged and low-income areas, as \ndesignated by California and the Justice40 Initiative.“The \npositive impacts of EV charging stations on businesses are not \nconstrained solely to some high-income neighborhoods,” Wang says. “It \nhighlights the importance for policymakers to develop EV charging \nstations in marginalized areas, because they not only foster a cleaner \nenvironment, but also serve as a catalyst for enhancing economic \nvitality.”Zheng believes the findings hold a lesson for charging \nstation developers seeking to improve the profitability of their \nprojects.“The joint gas station and convenience store business \nmodel could also be adopted to EV charging stations,” Zheng says. \n“Traditionally, many gas stations are affiliated with retail store \nchains, which enables owners to both sell fuel and attract customers to \ndiversify their revenue stream. EV charging providers could consider a \nsimilar approach to internalize the positive impact of EV charging \nstations.”Zheng also says the findings could support the creation\n of new funding models for charging stations, such as multiple \nbusinesses sharing the costs of construction so they can all benefit \nfrom the added spending.Those changes could accelerate the \ncreation of charging networks, but Zheng cautions that further research \nis needed to understand how much the study’s findings can be \nextrapolated to other areas. She encourages other researchers to study \nthe economic effects of charging stations and hopes future research \nincludes states beyond California and even other countries.“A \nhuge number of studies have focused on retail sales effects from \ntraditional transportation infrastructure, such as rail and subway \nstations, bus stops, and street configurations,” Zhao says. “This \nresearch provides evidence for an important, emerging piece of \ntransportation infrastructure and shows a consistently positive effect \non local businesses, paving the way for future research in this area.”The\n research was supported, in part, by the Singapore-MIT Alliance for \nResearch and Technology (SMART) and the Singapore National Research \nFoundation. Diao was partially supported by the Natural Science \nFoundation of Shanghai and the Fundamental Research Funds for the \nCentral Universities of China."},
